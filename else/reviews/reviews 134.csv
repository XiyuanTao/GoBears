B08YFD3WSG,2022,3,16,2,Pretty in the tube,3.0 out of 5 stars,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2021",Liz,,Verified Purchase,,"This lip balm is pretty in the tube, looks like an opal. The color turns into an unflattering neon highlighter hot pink on my lips. It doesn't really stain your lips evenly it sort of sits on top of your skin. The formula is a bit drying,waxy and has an odd scent. The sparkles do stick to your lips in an akward way which I dont really care for. I will just use this as a display because I have ph lipbalms that work alot better with less of the cons",2022-03-16 04:08:51.423712

You also get almost no sparkles on your lips. It's like dollar store children's quality. Very disappointed.",2022-03-16 04:08:51.423712
B08YFD3WSG,2022,3,16,4,Don’t waste your money,1.0 out of 5 stars,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2021",big red,,Verified Purchase,,"I am a sucker for color changing lipsticks. This essence glimmer glow looks beautiful. I was really excited to try it. It’s very dry. It doesn’t feel like a lipstick at all. It feels like I have nothing on but it’s drying at the same time if that makes sense. The color is a very sheer neon pink which is not very pretty. Also true huge glitter flakes look pretty but are annoying when one comes off on your lip and  you have to pick it off. This is a no for me. Save your 4$, that will buy you two la colors mood glosses at 2$ each in store and they’re moisturizing and an amazing shade of pink",2022-03-16 04:08:51.423712

It feels more like a ChapStick... With a Pink stain in it. Price is unbeatable. I also think it looks different on different kind of lips, meaning...lip color, skin color and so on. Not a bad product at all just not for me.",2022-03-16 04:08:51.423712
