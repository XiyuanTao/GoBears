B09M8C7QBG,2022,3,16,1,"small recorder with both side camera, clear picture, connect with phone",5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2022",Nelson,,Verified Purchase,,"I have this recorder for 2 weeks already, I put this on my windshield, it is easy to install. There are double side tapes and cable fixer come with the package, I sticked  the camera on the top of the windshield beside of the I-pass case, I put the cord on the edge of the window with the cable fixer, that is perfect, looks neat and will not  interfere with driving. The LED screen is 2 inches, not big, so camera is small and cute. The screen can display both front and inside image at the same time, and the picture is very clear, the front camera is 2K and the inside camera is 1080P, I like it. The function that I like it most is this camera can connect with my phone by WiFi, so I can check the picture or video at any time  on my phone when I need that.",2022-03-16 05:47:36.048723
B09M8C7QBG,2022,3,16,2,a must have dash dam,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2022",Flowinz,,Verified Purchase,,"I bought this mainly because of safety reasons; you can't predict when accident happens and you can't argue with something that could go both ends.  With this dash cam, I drive with peace of mind.  This dash cam is not big and this is what I need; I don't want something that might block my view at any angle. The package came with everything I needed to install and the installation process was painless.  I can make changes on settings after downloading the app, which was easy to do.  The best of all, I can download videos on the app, no wires needed!!",2022-03-16 05:47:36.048723
B09M8C7QBG,2022,3,16,3,Well Worth the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2022",Evelyn,,Verified Purchase,,"After almost being sideswiped a few times and then cut off in traffic, I decided to buy a camera for my vehicle in case I ever needed to prove the bad behaviors of these crazy drivers. This camera is a bit smaller than I was expecting,  but that is actually a good thing since it gets mounted on the windshield. I had this for a couple months, what I have seen so far are pretty decent videos and easy-to-use controls . It took me a while to figure out how to connect the WiFi to download the videos, it would be better if instructions have more explicit usage",2022-03-16 05:47:36.048723
