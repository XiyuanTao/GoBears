(Color descriptions in review below),5.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2022",Daniel P. Sniderman,,,,"I am in my 50s, with light yellow-toned skin and auburn hair. I found all but one of these shades to be extremely flattering and wearable. I wasn’t sure what to expect since Clinique has a reputation for offering somewhat dated and overly frosty colors. But they’ve clearly worked on their lipstick range. These shades are gorgeous!",2022-03-16 04:16:36.357524
