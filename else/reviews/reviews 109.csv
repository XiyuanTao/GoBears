Besides the body wash, I bought the bar soap and antiperspirant, all in the Extra Fresh scent. The soap is not too bad, but it melts very quickly. The antiperspirant is good but read below. I have 3 problems with this body wash. I use a large loofa in the shower. This stuff makes hardly any foam or suds, even when using a lot! I used other body washes from Nivea and Bath & Body Works that explode with suds using only a dollop. Not this stuff! Maybe a washcloth would work better, but I love my loofa.  I know that scent is very subjective. The smell is nice but a little overpowering. However, it fades pretty quickly and becomes acceptable. The biggest problem that I had with this body wash was that it doesn't really clean! Even after scrubbing with a loofa, I could still feel the residue from my Dove antiperspirant under my arms! I had to use the bar soap to get the stickiness off. I will try using some full-strength body wash under each arm first and see if that makes any difference. Won't be buying any more Dove body wash.",2022-03-16 03:28:07.883711

B0837311RV,2022,3,16,3,It easily gets in my eyes and burns a lot.,2.0 out of 5 stars,10 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2021",wonderful guy,,Verified Purchase,,"Maybe this wont happen to you, but it gets in my eyes quite easily and burns, especially the one eye that I had catarac surgery on.  It burns both eyes but gets in that one real easy?  I dont even use it on my face anymore.  I should have tried one bottle first now I have 4 that I dont like.  I do like Old Spice Shea butter body wash though. It does not get in my eyes and it seems to be more moisturizing.  I am 73 and my skin gets dry especially in the winter but the Old Spice Shea butter works.  I thought the name Dove would be good but this one is kind of harsh.",2022-03-16 03:28:07.883711

This is not something I have ever associated with the name DOVE. I also found that the fumes/scent were causing eye irritation. I had not expected Dove Men+Care Body Wash and Shower Gel Extra Fresh to have any scent. This was my fault. The product info clearly states that Extra Fresh means scented.  Both my wife and I found it heavy and overpowering.,2022-03-16 03:28:07.883711
