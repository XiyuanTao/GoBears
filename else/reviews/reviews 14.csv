OH shopper,,Verified Purchase,,"I wished I'd known  this earlier but OGX hair products (now owned by Johnson & Johnson) contain DMDM Hydantoin.  I have used this shampoo for 3 years because I wanted  a sulfate free shampoo.  I noticed hair loss but attributed it to aging, but have been concerned.  I never suspected a hair care product could be causing this. I checked ingredients on back of renewing + aragan oil of morocco shampoo, and sure enough, DMDM, a form of formaldehyde used by Johnson & Johnson as a preservative, is listed as an ingredient.  Googling can kick up case info:  Whipple-v-Johnson and Johnson",2022-03-16 01:18:18.981901

Not happy with the way it was shipped!,1.0 out of 5 stars,20 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2020",LoLong,,Verified Purchase,,"I love this shampoo & conditioner!!! It smells great and leaves my hair shiny and soft. But the reason for the low review is bc when I received my order, the lid on the shampoo was busted with a chunk missing, the piece wasn‚Äôt in the box, and there was half a bottle of shampoo in the box. I have tried several numbers for Amazon, just to get a message directing me to the website, then hangs up. I tried doing it online, it tells me the product isn‚Äôt eligible for return. So what do I do now? I paid for a full bottle, not a half full bottle.",2022-03-16 01:18:18.981901

I can't even describe it. It's amber, chunky, noticeably different smell, lathers in a different way. Unpleasant. Had to check that I got this from OGX store because I'd otherwise say this was the seller filling the bottle with a different product... And I mean they definitely are, but I suppose it's a new formula and this shampoo line has died. Shame but... Just gross.",2022-03-16 01:18:18.981901
B0048F5ATO,2022,3,16,5,Good shampoo for sensitive skin and fried hair,5.0 out of 5 stars,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2020",M,,Verified Purchase,,"My poor hair! I haven't had a cut since February, and I started with a pixie cut, so I've got quite the ridiculous quarantine mullet going on.  It's OK if I flat iron it to hide the weird length, but that doesn't help with the splits/damage from not getting it cut.  So this shampoo has a lot of work to do.  Plus, I ride horses, so it's having to take on helmet head.  And all that without sulfates!  It's awesome.  I end up with clean, shiny, soft hair.  I've also got very sensitive skin, so I'm often allergic to new shampoos.  This doesn't irritate my scalp at all.  Two thumbs up!!!",2022-03-16 01:18:18.981901

B0048F5ATO,2022,3,16,7,"Used to be amazing, now only average.",2.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2021",Paul Theodoropoulos,,Verified Purchase,,"Well, a month ago, I'd have given this five stars, but the latest bottle I received is...essentially a completely different product. It used to have a smooth, pearlescent quality, flowed from the bottle smoothly, had a lovely fragrance. My latest bottle? Consistency is completely changed. It's now...gloppy. That's the best word I can think of. It comes out of the bottle in sort of jelly like clumps. It breaks apart in the hand into...smaller glops. It has a completely different fragrance, nothing like before, and weak. That said, my hair seems to come out of the experience roughly the same. So I'll continue to use up this bottle. But after that, I'm not so sure. Frustrating to effectively been sold a completely different product from what I originally bought, without any 'warning' (like ""New Fragrance! New texture!"" on the bottle).",2022-03-16 01:18:18.981901
B0048F5ATO,2022,3,16,8,"Wonderful product, read my experience for info about my hair type etc. Try it out for yourself.",5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021",Andrea Moscoso,,Verified Purchase,,"Its great I still love this formula but I do honestly prefer the other formula which is the extra strength version. I find my hair and skin take to it better and doesn't at all trigger any acne in fact since I have so many skin allergies to face wash products and soap products from other companies I have resorted to washing my face with the extra strength version and my face has been taking well to the extra strength version, with no acne, no rashes and no enlarging of pores from it. Whether its correct or not I finally found something that I can also wash my face with that won't cause me any emergence of skin rashes nor does it seem to cause any acne and I have been using it for months. This version that is not extra strength I also use at times on my face too and I do find that occassionally it might cause a pimple or two and very occasionally some slight redness that usually clears up quickly. Now for the part that most people are interested in I have brunette and fine not thin/ thinning hair and both regular and extra strength versions even without the conditioner leave your hair extra silky smooth more manageable for my hair texture and fine hair type and bring out my natural colors and tones that are sometimes opaqued by cheap or heavily moisturizing shampoos. Both shampoos do give your hair aome good balanced volume but for all that I stated the shine the extra tones and more clearer lights/ highlights on my hair volume, and maintaining the health and luster I still recommend the extra strength version. Both are good but the extra strengrh version in my case just goes the extra mile and takes the cake in my opinion and experience. I still give this product 5/ 5 stars. I still reccomend to add the extra strength argan oil conditioner it'll do even more wonders for you and leave an even more beautiful luster that brings out/ highlights your natural highlights. üòâ",2022-03-16 01:18:18.981901
