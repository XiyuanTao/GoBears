The bottles felt different & the smell was definitely different. I will be asking for a full refund!",2022-03-16 01:24:28.837861

I have used Keranique only twice, but each time the result has been much less than wow. Apparently it's not a color-care shampoo (I concur with some other reviews in that it seems to drag the color down), and though it has a pleasant enough scent and lathers nicely, it has not done anything noticeable in the hair-growth and hair-thickening department. The conditioner on the other hand is plain horrible. It is waaaay too light and does not detangle the hair, AT ALL. My hair doesn't feel anywhere near smooth after working the product in, I have to use a comb and use an enormous amount to reach the desired result. Which is not reached, regardless. My stylist advised not to use any voluminizing products because they tend to leave you hair dry and brittle. Am going back to my store-bought Herbal Essences ""Color Me Happy"" combo which leave my hair feeling so smooth. Conclusion: This Keranique purchase was equal to throwing 40 bucks into the garbage. At least for my type of hair, but that's precisely the point.",2022-03-16 01:24:28.837861

I was using Paul Mitchell products before which are great but nothing compares to Keranique products when you have thin hair and are looking for volume.  The overall structure of my hair has even improved and it gives amazing volume when you blow dry your hair.  I am literally blown away.  Amazing product!,2022-03-16 01:24:28.837861
