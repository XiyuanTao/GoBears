B000XQQ5QO,2022,3,16,1,Very nice Body wash,4.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2011",Guitarhack,,Verified Purchase,,This is Khiels....what more can I say. If you like their musk scent you will like this product. My only complaint is that the item came with a crack in the cap which makes it impossible to travel with with out transfering it to a different bottle.,2022-03-16 02:42:11.478843
B000XQQ5QO,2022,3,16,2,Good Body Wash But Priced Too High,3.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2013",MGTOW Gamer,,,,"I've bought a bottle of this body wash about a week ago from Macy's and used it 4 times. I knew the fragrance for years so decided to pony-up $18 plus tax and give a body wash a try. Smells like the fragrance sprays but when you wash off the gel, the scent goes away. For $18 Kielh's could have formulated it a bit better with longer-lasting projection [like Old Spice does for 1/4 of the price of Kiehl's]. Its good, but it can be better and probably can also cost less. I bet that some manufacturer can knock-off the musk scents and stam-out much cheaper products than Kiehl's.",2022-03-16 02:42:11.478843
