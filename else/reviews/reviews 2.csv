        TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,I have been using the Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening shampoo and conditioner for years now.  My hair stylist first recommended it and it has worked really well on my fine and thin men's hair.  I think some get this thinking it is going to provide fuller and thicker hair that remains and does not go away.  Meaning it will over time provide permanently thicker hair.  That just is not possible.  What this does do with consistent use is after I wash with the shampoo and then use the conditioner is provide fuller and softer hair after each wash.  The fullness is very refreshing and natural.  This shampoo smells very nice and lathers up very easily.  With other shampoos I would feel build-up over time but not with this.  I also appreciate the savings buying it in large volume like here.  But what I do not appreciate it that even when purchased from Amazon themselves as I made sure to do this time the large bottle arrived with some of the shampoo leaking out the top.  It was all over the bottle and a pain to wash off but overall a minimal amount though no amount should be the correct amount.  But the shampoo itself will indeed add volume in a natural way to fine and thinning hair.,2022-03-16 00:11:07.921652

One day my stylist used the Paul Mitchell special shampoo and conditioner on me at the salon and I found myself totally in love with the smell and the way the it made my scalp tingle... And once my hair was dried and styled, I was excited to see some oomph despite the stylist not using any other volumizing products. When I asked her about it I was expecting her to tell me that it was one of the usual high end products that are normally used at salons- you know, the ones that cost like $50 a bottle- but was thrilled to learn how inexpensive they are despite their good quality. Needless to say, I ended up leaving the salon with a couple of bottles and it's been my standard shampoo/conditioner ever since. I have tried other products over the years, such as specialty shampoos that promise to improve strength, growth, and volume, but I always find myself going back to this. I really do feel that my hair is healthier and grows more quickly because of it. I also love this brand because there are several different types and scents To choose from (not sure if they are all technically part of the ""special"" line, but they do come in the same little green bottles, unlike the other Paul Mitchell products) and I've enjoyed playing around with different combinations. Currently my favorite combo is the lemon sage shampoo with the lavender mint conditioner (although I do still love the tea tree shampoo as well). I've been using these products for about 5 years now and I plan to continue using them so long as they stay available and affordable. And I absolutely recommend them to anyone with fine, flat hair like mine!",2022-03-16 00:11:07.921652

Over the last few years, it has begun to thin gradually. Nothing crazy, but over time its lost some of its volume. Not to a point that a nice wash with a good shampoo wouldn't be able to hide any noticeable lack of coverage. I've used Organix (OGX) biotin shampoo, Avalon Organics biotin etc. and was happy with both. Nothing but typical couple loose hairs while shampooing or a few loose hairs when brushing afterwards. I was running low and decided to give this biotin a try seeing it had added claims such as DHT blocking properties.  I cannot regret that decision more. After a couple weeks of using this product my hair began falling out in clumps and my scalp became extremely itchy and flaky. Its typical for anyone to lose up to 100 hairs a day but this lead to over 100 per wash and every brush. I'd brush in the afternoon to check if it was still happening when dry and I'd lose even more. All I had to do was run a flat hand down my head and I'd be picking up 50 or more hairs out of the sink. I stopped immediately after realizing it had to be the shampoo. After a couple weeks of stopping with the shampoo the constant extreme itching has stopped and the flakes have lessened significantly but the hair fall is still more than I've ever experienced at any other time in my life.

Even with this, I felt a heavy residue after thoroughly rinsing, and my hair was greasy by the next day. Some might like the scent of the product, but I found the heavy vanilla like smell to be too heavy and rather noxious. Because of how much product I had to use, I‚Äôm ultimately not saving any money from more expensive products that I use significantly less of. I‚Äôm not even going to bother using this product again.

I bought this product along with the corresponding conditioner upon recommendation from my hairstylist, and at first I thought it was a miracle, because it made my hair so soft and sleek. I was so excited, and spent $60 bucks on more of it after I used my first order. However- around the 6 month mark, I noticed my scalp was flaking more than usual. I chalked it up to winter weather, and ignored it - until I started noticing scabby patches appearing under my hair. I could not understand what was causing it, and tried discontinuing leave in conditioners, and changing pillowcases and diet- but nothing worked. The final straw was when my follicles started detaching: hair would drift down from my head in the middle of the day and I would see it on my shirts or in my car. It was awful- and then when I was reordering this shampoo, I noticed one of the one star reviews ALSO mentioned hair loss and dry scalp. I stopped using it and my scalp healed by the next week, and my hair loss has stopped over the last month. I switched to Garnier triple nutrition and that works way better with no irritation, and costs $7 at Target. So I would not recommend this- I spent $120 prolonging my hair recovery journey.",2022-03-16 00:12:53.051467

This shampoo is different. First of all, even though the price may seem steep, you only need a very small amount to get coverage.  I used this shampoo as  the after treatment for Olaplex No. 3.  It lathers very well and smells nice. I did not use any conditioner after, and my hair is soft and tangle free. I have natural grey hair that is rather dry at the ends, and this helps tame the ends.  In addition, I flat iron my hair. With Olaplex, my hair is already more smooth after the treatment and shampoo, so when I flat iron, I don't need to spend as much time with the iron! Even two days after treatment and styling, my hair is still soft and flowing. Together with Olaplex No. 3, I am already seeing the difference in my hair, and I am happy. Grey hair is not easy to tame, so I have tried many products. Olaplex is the solution I have been waiting for.",2022-03-16 00:13:20.720944

Once my scalp was dry it would be stinging slightly like a burn and the next day my scalp would be flaking off! The same happened to my fiance. I then googled this product & the reviews were saying the same exact thing! This CR@P needs to be DISCONTINUED! It says moisturizing on the bottle too, what a joke!

I bought it in hopes of changing the outermost layer from a light blonde back to silver which hasn't happened. I don't know why some of my hair turned blonde--regular shampoo, leave-in hair products to keep my very thick unruly hair tame, or too much sun except I always wear a hat? It used to be very dark chestnut brown in my youth (never blonde). I never died my hair, it started changing to salt & pepper in my early 30s, now more salt than pepper in my early 60s. Strangers, even hair dressers, told me how beautiful my hair color was, I could trust them over family/friends :-)  Six yrs ago my hairdresser helped me grow it out from a very short style and suggested shampoo for silver hair which I never tried until this. I've been thinking if it was still short, cut regularly, this lavender tinting wouldn't have happened, but just today I noticed an attractive woman with almost white short hair and could see a slight tint of lavender to it! I asked my husband if I was imagining it, he said no, he saw it too. From what others have reviewed this doesn't happen to everyone but it can happen! I've now tossed this shampoo & conditioner and have bought a shampoo for blonde hair promising to make it two shades lighter in hopes it might remove the lavender and the blonde from my hair. I just hope like one reviewer mentioned that it doesn't turn green! I may have to have it cut very short again and start over. Of course these days any color, every color, seems to be in :-) It's amazing that young women are dying their hair to look grey which usually has a lavender or blue tint to it.",2022-03-16 00:15:42.748526

B086CS8YXB,2022,3,16,1,Secret Hair Growth,5.0 out of 5 stars,58 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2021",Amy H,,Verified Purchase,,"My goal for this product was to achieve hair growth which may not be your primary motivation. About two years ago I noticed that my hair was thinning badly. I‚Äôm going to be 58 next month and I have left  what used to constitute One pigtail that‚Äôs now a single ponytail.  . I had the classic male pattern thinning above my temples and with my bangs. I was completely freaking out as my hair is kind of my signature feature. It‚Äôs always been wavy and fine but pretty. I also let my silver grow out about four years ago and the lack of processing has made my hair healthy,  shiny and soft. At the end of 2018 I embarked on this research project about how to re-grow my hair and keep what I have from hair care products, the way that I treat my hair,  and nutrition. They said not to keep your hair tightly wrapped up and to let it flow, that washing your hair every other day was better because it removes buildup on the scalp, so I dumped the Pantene and tried the biotin shampoo starting two years ago. At the same time I start Taking the 5000 mg of biotin pills for hair and nails from natures bounty that I got at Costco. And at the beginning of 2019 I research which vitamins and foods to eat which include anything high in vitamin A like red and yellow bell peppers, red cabbage, spinach, Sweet potatoes, Butternut squash and cauliflower‚Ä¶ along with almonds sunflower seeds salmon eggs and Greek yogurt.  I bough this Nizoral In April 2019. As of today I have an entire undercoat of fine new hair but it‚Äôs only about 4 inches which leads me to believe that the biotin shampoo really didn‚Äôt affect things all that much. Four Inches of hair growth is about 8 months. So I went back on to Amazon to see you when I first bought this  dandruff shampoo and lo and behold it was in April which is eight months today - January 1, 2021. I do believe that nutrition is key along with stress management and sleep course. But I find it really interesting that I‚Äôm able to trace the number of inches to when I bought this shampoo.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs 100% direct correlation but I can testify that is working for me in the hair growth department. I also found a different hair growth vitamin that I‚Äôm going to start using next week.  It‚Äôs called Hair La Vie.  Last observation. I did use Nioxin 3  for a number of years and I don‚Äôt think it worked as well as the shampoo coupled with the nutrition. Because I still had a lot of hair thinning of the temples which is now filling in considerably. And also Nioxin dries your hair out badly. I like alternating between the biotin shampoo and this dandruff shampoo because the Biotin Shampoo is less drying than Nizoral.  The key is to get it worked up into your scalp really well and just let it sit there for a while so you have to like use it less often. I hope this helps you I know How agonizing it is to lose your hair especially when you‚Äôre a woman. Good luck",2022-03-16 00:16:03.426850

You MUST use conditioner on the tips of your hair every time after using this shampoo, because it does leave your hair feeling very dry.

(1) I have no idea if this is supposed to for all hair types. It isn't. (2) In 2016 my husband and I went through a stressful time with a company - not wow - that ruined my stress level and caused my hair to thin out more than what it already was. When dealing with that company was done with, my hair was not thinning out as much and i wanted to try and get new hair growing in and work in decreasing hair falling out. I tried the wow acv and I noticed more hair was coming out than regular shampoo. I read it was not really for helping hair to grow back so I stopped. However, my oldest, who had incredible thick hair, used it because she loved the smell of it. She stopped using it after a month, but never said why until recently. Will get to that in a bit. (2) I started using the wow coconut to help with stimulating hair growth. THe hair loss was the same for women my age with thin hair. early 40's it happens but was not that bad at all. I only wanted to stimulate the hair growth where it was showing thinness in some areas. I used the wow coconut the first time. 3-4 times the hair came out than with regular shampoo. I used regular shampoo the next time. the usual 5-15 strands of hair would come out. I would hten use the coconut. 3-4 times the hair comes out than with regular shampoo. I emailed wow and they said not to use any other shampoo and to only use theirs to be effective. I then washed my hair with wow coconut and 3-4 times the hair came out than with regular shampoo. didn't wash it for 2 days. used coconut wow shampoo again, 3-4 times the hair came out. waited another two days before washing my hair again. I was nervous to use it again, but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. washed it and sure enough. 3-4 times the hair loss from regular shampoo. I know everyone loses on average 100 strands of hair a day, but this was insane. I then decided I was done and I needed to find the shampoo that did work for stimulating hair growth and did work (the only reason I stopped that one was because the peppermint was so strong it made me lightheaded, but I would rather wash my hair in the kitchen sink and endure the strong peppermint and have a product that works then lose hair with wow). I had asked my oldest who used the wow acv if she still uses it. she said no. I asked her why because I was curious if it was causing her beautiful think hair to thin out and it thinned out a lot. she flat out said she stopped using it because of all the hair that was falling out when she used it. She went from having to have her hair thinned out every 2-3 months with a pile that looked like a small bunny to having thin hair. This only happened when she used the wow. She said when she uses anything but wow, she has no problems with hair falling out. I don't know why the wow coconut and acv shampoos made our hair fall out, I was really having hopes with all the reviews, but there is nothing wrong with either of us for our hair to be falling out like this. Again, it only falls out 3-4 more when we use the wow coconut and acv. If we use suave, tressemme, herbal essence, we do not have an issue at all. We have the normal amount fall out that we have our entire lives that is common for everyone. I will be seeing if I can return it since it is in the time frame. I want to keep my hair. Not have it thin out 3-4 times faster than what it normally would have.",2022-03-16 00:16:36.198883

        TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,I have been using the Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening shampoo and conditioner for years now.  My hair stylist first recommended it and it has worked really well on my fine and thin men's hair.  I think some get this thinking it is going to provide fuller and thicker hair that remains and does not go away.  Meaning it will over time provide permanently thicker hair.  That just is not possible.  What this does do with consistent use is after I wash with the shampoo and then use the conditioner is provide fuller and softer hair after each wash.  The fullness is very refreshing and natural.  This shampoo smells very nice and lathers up very easily.  With other shampoos I would feel build-up over time but not with this.  I also appreciate the savings buying it in large volume like here.  But what I do not appreciate it that even when purchased from Amazon themselves as I made sure to do this time the large bottle arrived with some of the shampoo leaking out the top.  It was all over the bottle and a pain to wash off but overall a minimal amount though no amount should be the correct amount.  But the shampoo itself will indeed add volume in a natural way to fine and thinning hair.,2022-03-16 00:16:49.933870

One day my stylist used the Paul Mitchell special shampoo and conditioner on me at the salon and I found myself totally in love with the smell and the way the it made my scalp tingle... And once my hair was dried and styled, I was excited to see some oomph despite the stylist not using any other volumizing products. When I asked her about it I was expecting her to tell me that it was one of the usual high end products that are normally used at salons- you know, the ones that cost like $50 a bottle- but was thrilled to learn how inexpensive they are despite their good quality. Needless to say, I ended up leaving the salon with a couple of bottles and it's been my standard shampoo/conditioner ever since. I have tried other products over the years, such as specialty shampoos that promise to improve strength, growth, and volume, but I always find myself going back to this. I really do feel that my hair is healthier and grows more quickly because of it. I also love this brand because there are several different types and scents To choose from (not sure if they are all technically part of the ""special"" line, but they do come in the same little green bottles, unlike the other Paul Mitchell products) and I've enjoyed playing around with different combinations. Currently my favorite combo is the lemon sage shampoo with the lavender mint conditioner (although I do still love the tea tree shampoo as well). I've been using these products for about 5 years now and I plan to continue using them so long as they stay available and affordable.

I realize from using hair dye in the past that it's the amount of time that is on your head that matters the most especially on the coarse hairs on the sides. The directions state only use it for a minute or two, you're not going to get any effect from it in any great way with such little time. From day one, after the allergy test, I started using it on my entire head for at least 10 minutes. Since we're in quarantine I have all the time in the world so I did this three times each day. My hair to start with was basically 60% Gray, fully noticeable. At the end of day three using it three times a day 10 minutes each time the top of my head which is longer was basically finished and looked perfect. But the sides still had very noticeable greys and I have my sides cut very short. I remember my barber would always leave the hair dye on much longer than recommended. I decided to see what would happen if I started to use it only on my sides for 20 minutes at a time. Bingo after two days three times per day I have even color throughout. Now I can use the maintenance dosage when needed which would probably only be once every two or three days. I realize not everyone has the time to do this three times per day but at least leave it on longer for about 20 to 30 minutes in the beginning..the results will come quickly and then you can get to your maintenance ASAP without having to worry about the stubborn course greys.",2022-03-16 00:19:03.541838

For example, I left the product on for 3 minutes the first time. It definitely toned down the brassiness in my hair, but it wasn't quite the silver color I was trying to achieve. I waited a few days and a couple of shampoos later, I tried again and left it on for about 6 minutes and there was quite a bit of silver tone to it. So, it really depends on what color you are trying to achieve. I am trying to stay current with the silvery blonde look that seems to be in now.

I have very thick, oily, and heavy hair that after about 12 hours, feels greasy (and sometimes looks it too). About a month ago I realized I wasn't able to fully wash product out of my head even when using just a little bit and washing it out for 30+ minutes. Every single day after drying my hair for over an hour, I'd find a clump of shampoo/conditioner stuck in the back of my head. I couldn't get this out no matter what treatments I did, no matter what product I used, etc. I went through multiple bottles and brands of shampoos and none of it worked. I then came across this product and bought it as my last hope. I washed with this shampoo two days in a row and my hair no longer has left over product it, it stays soft and light for over 24 hours now, and I can't say enough good things about the consistency and sent of the product itself.

I didnt think purple shampoos work... i mean they didnt until i bleached my hair ice blonde. It really only works on bleached hair in my experience.

One time i left it in for 10 min and my hair came out looking purple tinged... which ended up being okay because when you dry it, it comes out looking grey silver which is what i wanted that day. At 15 min my hair came out actually purple. But It washes off after a few shampoos luckily. So it really works!

After coloring and highlighting my thick, beautiful hair since the age of 17, having children, becoming older, my hair was a frizzy, brittle, product-needing, thinning mess.  I had to style my hair more and more and use more and more products to help it look nice.  I then started a new job and began working for an older woman who had the most incredible head of shiny and thick salt and pepper and silver hair.  I asked her what products she used and she said none.  She told me she washed and conditioned only.  She said the secret was to not color your hair and find a shampoo that kept your scalp healthy but didn't fry your hair.  She said, take care of your scalp so it is able to grow healthy hair, and don't abuse your hair once it has grown out.  It was such simple advice.  I stopped coloring and highlighting right then and there.  I won't lie.  It was rough at first and I felt ugly. The grow out was tough.  I did end up cutting it short once it had grown out a bit to get rid of all the processed fried hair.  I am glad I stuck with it, though.  Three years into my natural hair journey, my hair is healthy and shiny and growing like a weed.  I have light brown hair with an awesome silver streak on the top of my head.  That was another discovery, I had no idea what hair color I had.  Anyways, once my hair grew out, I wanted to invest in a shampoo that would promote a healthy scalp and nourish my hair.  This shampoo does the trick.  I no longer have dandruff and my hair is light and full of body without frizz.  And, after years of blow drying and using a straightener, I now wash my hair and let it air dry.  I have shiny, beach waves with lots of volume and no frizz.  This shampoo cleans my scalp so well but does not strip my hair.  I only have to wash my hair twice per week and it always looks good.  I have noticed that since I started using this shampoo, my scalp no longer itches and there is definitely less hair in the drain.",2022-03-16 00:21:41.178332

I matched my hair type on their website to their suggestions and ordered this for me to use and for my teen daughter with loose curly hair. I wish I could give it 5 starts, because the ingredients are much safer than most other shampoos, but I can't because it is NOT good for typical caucasian hair in my opinion. People with dry curls may like it and it likely is great for those that want a REALLY HEAVY THICK moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it was so thick that my daughter's hair looked about 3 shades darker until she rewashed it with Acure (which we've used for the past few years).",2022-03-16 00:22:01.903262

My hair was brittle and seemed always dry no matter what products I would put on it. I thought that I would have had to cut my hair and start completely over. However, when my products arrived, I could not wait to give them a try. I love the smells. Very nice and not powerful. I washed my hair twice with the Nexxus Shampoo, first time just the scalp, and the second wash, the hair itself. The way that my hair reacted to this shampoo was breathtaking! My curls appeared and believe it or not, I was able to pull a comb through my thick, natural, 4C  hair!! I have never, ever been able to do this before while washing. Barely any hair was coming out in my comb! I had not even used the conditioner yet. I just had to stop and look in the mirror and talk to myself saying, ""Omg, I cannot believe this""! I have never, ever experienced a shampoo doing my hair like this before. After I completely rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I moved on to the Nexxus Conditioner. Even more amazing. It stated to leave on the hair for 3 min, but I sat under a hooded dryer for about 10min with the conditioner on my hair, under a plastic cap. Once my time was up, I rinsed away all of the conditioner. My hair was so manageable!! I was able to comb and section it to do my bantu knots and allow my hair to dry overnight. After washing my hair, it only took me about 30 min to get it  all done to dry. I have never been able to complete this process this quickly before! I am highly satisfied with these products! Even though they are  expensive products, I'm hooked and will be purchasing again. I told my mom about my experience and am ready to try it on her hair also, to see if she gets the same experience and satisfaction that I got. Thank you Nexxus for such wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them. Definitely a must try on the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner for Severely damaged hair.

Let me first say I have well water, I use heat on my hair and get highlights on my long fine hair so I have some pretty extensive damage. Short of cutting it all off (not ready for that yet) I decided to give it a try after a YouTuber I follow recommended it for my healthier hair journey. I've used A LOT of salon quality shampoos in the past, never being impressed for all the money I fork out on them. My last shampoo purchase was a drugstore brand that I got because it was the most amazing smelling stuff ever and I was tired of spending money and getting the same results. (I know, blasphemy). Finally coming to grips I needed to spend the money and switch back to a better brand if I was ever going to heal my damaged hair, I took the leap. And let me tell you I'm so glad I did. First off, I didn't even mind getting rid of the drug store brand after I used this stuff. Holy heavens to Betsy, it smells amazing! I've been sniffing my hair all day! My hair feels super soft, it's shiny and frizzy split ends are softer and less noticeable. This is after ONE wash y'all. I can't wait to see what it does after 6 months of use, combined with the other changes I'm making for healthier hair. Once I've used it more, I'll leave another updated review about how long the shampoo/conditioner has lasted and how it's helped my hair.

I like to lift to a level 6-7 and apply a red from there just for example of vibrancy. I wash my hair once a week maybe twice tops when it‚Äôs red to really hold in the color. This shampoo certainly helps my hair to last 4-5 weeks before needing retouch of color which helps so much. The scent is that of a Candy but it doesn‚Äôt linger or stay past my other products being applied. This does not leave your hair super moisturized on its own, you 100% need to use a conditioner in pair with it.

I have silky fine thick hair that is often just limp and fizzy. This shampoo help clean away all the junk that weighs it down and provides a bit of shiny volume without the frizz.  I don't need to use more than a nickel /quarter-sized amount to wash for my medium long hair. I do occasionally wash twice if I skipped a day to wash my hair. Definitely use a small amount of the complimenting conditioner to help smooth hair and minimize tangling. Do comb your hair before washing, I find it helps minimize tangles and snarls too. DELIVERY REVIEW: Kudos to the people for getting my shampoo to me. I wasn't suppose to get it for another month and it surprisingly arrived today!! I have been using a moisturizing shampoo that was just too much for my poor scalp because this was out-of-stock at all the local stores.

Always had lots of compliments on my ""silver hair"" (silver fox, etc.). Now in my 60's I am completely gray and noticed that it ""looked"" gray and not so ""silver"" anymore. I noticed that frequently there seemed to be a yellowish hue in certain lighting. I tried vinegar rinses and a few other suggestions I found online but never really felt anything changed. I bought this product after reading reviews on every Amazon listed shampoo for gray hair. I found a huge difference in prices. I selected this product because it seemed reasonably priced and I didn't want to spend a lot of money for something I wasn't sure would work.  I ordered it and received it promptly.  First use I noticed it was VERY purple and had some concern about staining shower area but that turned out to be not a problem. Left it on for 2-3 minutes as suggested.  Dried my hair with towel and went about dressing, etc. When I went to brush my hair before leaving for the office, I noticed that my hair once again looked more ""silver"" than gray.  I actually received a couple compliments that first day about how handsome I looked and I have to think it was related to the product.  I use it a couple times a week and it has a noticeable effect on keeping my hair more silver looking than gray. It also seems to a very good quality shampoo in addition to addressing the gray back to silver issue.

My mom, however, recently decided to grow out her grey hair, and was curious to try something that might make her hair pop a little.  I had heard purple shampoo can give grey hair a cool, silvery glow, so I decided to get her some.  First, I got her the Bedhead brand one, and she said it was a nice shampoo but did nothing in terms of color-depositing, and was barely even purple-toned out of the bottle.  My platinum blonde-haired friend highly recommended Milk Shake, and I could tell it was effective judging by the silvery purple glow on her own hair.  This shampoo was a total win for my mom.  Her hair looks so silvery and awesome.  From what I gather, you can either build this up so you get a purple sheen like my friend has by leaving it on for longer, or if you want to keep things subtle and not deposit any color, you can wash it out quicker.  I can't believe how great these results are, and I'm honestly jealous that I can't have hair like that.  She's already asked for another bottle, and I really hope Amazon keeps selling this because I don't think she'll switch away from this. I'm sure I'd look terrible with blonde hair, so I'll have to settle for seeing the super groovy effects on other people.",2022-03-16 00:42:04.596872

If I could give this product 10 stars then I would! I absolutely love anything from the Milk Shake brand and love how natural their products are! I first learned of Milk Shake from my hairdresser who praised the brand and began using it in her salon. This shampoo is a rich purple shampoo that instantly eliminates any yellow or brassy tones in blondes. I find that it is darker in color than most purple shampoos (wear gloves if you are worried about finger/nail/cuticle staining) and it is more moisturizing than any other purple shampoo I‚Äôve used. The shampoo smells wonderfully or berries and is my go to choice when my blonde needs a pick me up!

She said it was best on extensions and full lace wigs. I have a full lace that needed a little extra care because it has aged. I ordered and bought this product. I never put any product directly on the hair. I washed it, and the hair was not as silky as she said. It was tangled and course like. When I use regular shampoo it still had a silky texture and waved up. So I said the magic must be in the conditioner. When conditioning, it did not make a difference. After the full lace wigs dried, the smell was horrific. It is a super strong perfume smell. When I applied the wig, I had to take it off within 20 minutes because the scent was unbearable. I tried two times, each time airing out the hair hoping that it will die down. A week later and the scent was just as strong. On the finally day, I took my trusty Dawn dish detergent, because it strips anything (praying the entire time because the wig was 300 bucks), to strip the smell. It worked and my wig is back to normal. Can you imagine if I put it on my hair? I returned it immediately. UPDATE! The wig dried and the super perfume still remained. I could smell it wet. I have put it in a netted bag and put it in washing machine with Tide oxi. If that doesn't work, I will try baking soda. What type of chemical is this? Finally....I had to throw away full lace wigs.

If you like the scent this just might be the stuff for you. For me, it was a little difficult to get the pump working. I think I would prefer a regular pour cap top. It doesn't lather that heavily, and yes, I know, this is not any indication of how well it works. It is just that if you grew up with very lathery shampoo this might take some getting used to, I am not fond of the scent, which feels too thick and too heavy to me. After washing my hair it felt ok, as in: not bad. After my hair had fully dried, however, and I took a brush to my head, my hair turned out to feel silky and smooth like a very expensive coat. I like that alright. But probably not well enough to put up with the packaging and the smell. Earlier this year I reviewed another strongly perfumed vanilla scented shampoo, and for what it's worth, if I were going to over look the scent I would probably go back for that one.

Complaints about mushy soap? Well, don‚Äôt leave it in the tin with lid on it. Let it dry between use. Anything wet and sealed inside a metal tin will stay wet. Geez. Sigh. I love this product. I read the ingredients thoroughly and was not disappointed in the results. I‚Äôve stopped coloring my hair and my grey hair can be uncontrollable with dry scalp. My hair is smoother and less frizz and healthier than it has ever been. I personally like the scent as well. It‚Äôs a nice natural scent. So others complaining about scent clearly prefers the strong perfumes of bottle shampoo, the same shampoo laden with chemicals. So if you want clean, healthier hair with herbal scent then buy it.

B07TD6RPFY,2022,3,16,1,I didn't care for this product at all. Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2020",Amazon Customer,,Verified Purchase,,"I don't know if I somehow got ripped off and didn't get the actual Kenra product, because I have read other reviews that were good.  And I don't know how that would even happen. All I know is that the shampoo and conditioner both had a very light purple color to them which seems to jive with what I've read on the description of the product. Just for clarification, I have very thick but fine hair.  It's gotten thicker in recent years due to grey coming in.  My natural hair color is dark brown. But I have been bleaching it blonde in the last year.  So I decided to try this because I try to keep my hair a whitish silver blonde.  It's not even close to the typical blonde when you think of blonde hair, I think more of a yellowy gold color comes to mind because most natural blondes tend to have natural golden tones in their hair.  I am very pale, so gold or yellow doesn't look good on my skin tone.  I really wish it did.  So I did use it a few times to give it a chance but I had to stop using it, because right off the bat I noticed when I shampooed my hair with it, my hair which had felt fairly soft before instantly got knotty.  I don't know if there is a strong chemical in it that is meant to remove build up of  metals or minerals in your water that are known to yellow the hair. But whatever the reason I expected the conditioner to fix that.  I would have thought that the conditioner would make my hair soft and manageable again. But I was disappointed to soon find out that no, it did not. In fact it didn't seem to make any difference in the way my hair felt, which is important to me being that my hair might be thick but its very fine, so it makes it even harder to comb through without ripping and pulling half my hair out if its not soft enough after a shower. And using both of them I felt made very little difference in toning down the yellow.  For me whatever difference it did make was not worth the way it made my hair feel which was knotty and unmanageable and very dry feeling afterwards.  Many people with a different texture of hair may disagree, especially if your a natural blonde. Because if your hair is unprocessed maybe it wouldn't have the same effect.  But this was my experience.",2022-03-16 00:56:18.700081
