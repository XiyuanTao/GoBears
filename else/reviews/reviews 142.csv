The picture above is the darkest shade which was way too dark for me. My daughter however, who is wearing it loved it! The color lasted the entire day. Through three meals and multiple drinks. I did put a matte gloss over it after about 5 hours. Went on smooth and felt good...not sticky. Took off with an oil based make up remover. If the colors were actually different this product would get 5 stars.",2022-03-16 04:14:08.558438

I don't know what everyone is saying when they talk about this being long lasting. Maybe if you never eat, never drink, never get an itch, never sweat and always go heavy on the makeup setter it might be, but never wear it out to dinner where you might have to dab the corners of your mouth a couple of times. As soon as it gets even a tiny bit wet from a beverage or if you kiss someone, it'll immediately start wiping off.",2022-03-16 04:14:08.558438

The colors are ok, they all sort of look the same but what I hated the most is that it dries and cracks right off your lips. It is hard to explain but it turns kind of grainy and it just becomes tiny little particles which go on your teeth your face and even on your clothes. I was stained everywhere after wearing it. I think it stays on pretty much anywhere but your lips. The colors aren’t true to the picture, but the quality is what bothered me the most.",2022-03-16 04:14:08.558438

This does not take away from the quality of it though because the formula is very smooth and goes on well (I had chapstick under all of them which is recommended). It was a little hard for me using a wand because my hand is not as steady so I prefer actual lipstick. The nicest looking picture is #3 Jinx (my favorite of the bunch), the next is #14 Berry Me, and lastly #13 Fwtish. The only issue I had was with #4 since it went on a little patchy and you can tell in the photo. I did not wear these all day, but I have a feeling they will last because they're pretty tough to get off. Be prepared to have some coconut oil or some other oil based makeup remover because that's what works best/fastest. As for the matted aspect they all dried very nicely (see #13, they all ended like that but the other 2 I took a little premature so it looks wet). Overall they don't have any overwhelming scents and I really enjoyed this as my first matted lip wear!",2022-03-16 04:14:08.558438
