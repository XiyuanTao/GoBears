Anglin,,Verified Purchase,,This is a somewhat thick bodywash and leaves a silky feel on my skin. At first it drove me nuts bc I was thinking the soap would not come off but it was just its moisturizer. The smell is marvelous but some may not like it if sweet smells is not their thing. It's not overly sweet but some folks noses are different. As for the sensitive skin part... I'm not sure bc I don't have sensitive skin and don't want to give false hope to someone that does.,2022-03-16 02:14:11.641266

It was tough for me to find body wash and lotion for his skin. I used aquarphor and it didn't help do I sought to the aveeno sensitive body wash for babies until 4 years ago I found this body wash but with a cocoa butter body cream from Africa which I use. I haven't had any problems with his skin since. But I still use the aveeno sensitive body cream for his face,2022-03-16 02:14:11.641266

I use it everyday. The Aveeno bath shower products is helping my skin to stay nice and soft. I hope Aveeno comes out different scents of lotions. I have already tried the lavender and cocoa butter bath shower soap, I also love those scents too! I will recommend this to other customers.",2022-03-16 02:14:11.641266

But either way, my husband and I have had 2 allergic reactions each to this product. Full body itchiness and patches of bumps so over-the-top itchy that we find super swollen welts in areas from scratching so hard and not even realizing it. Benadryl helps some, but not completely. Takes days to go away, even when we change our soap. Would not recommend this to people with allergies or sensitive skin. And it had to be this specific product causing the reaction because it is the only new product either of us have used.",2022-03-16 02:14:11.641266

The smell is light and fresh. This doesn't dry out my skin and I coul probably get away with not moisturizing after my showers when using this but it is not as moisturizing as the Aveeno Vanilla and Oats body wash. It is still great, I just prefer the long lasting moisture of the Vanilla and Oats.",2022-03-16 02:14:11.641266
