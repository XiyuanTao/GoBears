The quality is great. The key chains are nice but I absolutely love the chapstick holders. I have one on my work bag, one on my daughter's backpack, one on my diaper bag and one in my car. It is so convenient not to have to dig around for your chapstick. It's great for my daughter too, she would always lose it, now she has access to it whenever needed.",2022-03-16 05:40:50.607666

I love them  ! I won’t ever pay more than how much I did here for them . But Etsy had them for 5 dollars each so I got a steal ! And they match my steering wheel cover perfect ! Delivery was perfect ! They are cheap but that’s what you get and you get them at a good price but even being cheap I’m impressed! And I loved reading the reviews so I’m making one,2022-03-16 05:40:50.607666

B07X9YPDBS,2022,3,16,5,Too small for EOS Chapstick,3.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020",Sportsync,,Verified Purchase,,"These work for generic standard chapstick, but are too slim for EOS chapstick wands that have long caps. My first and third grader could barely push them in, and when you pull them out the wand breaks or cap gets lodged in the holder. Super cute and I'm sure they work for most people, but we use only specific products for my kids and they don't work for us.",2022-03-16 05:40:50.607666
