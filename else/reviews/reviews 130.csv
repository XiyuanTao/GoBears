I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN. The first use it made my skin feel tight, but by the second use it burned my skin so badly the worse being on this cheek. I did not apply directly on skin as instructed so I rubbed some on a clean washcloth and created a lather to apply to my face. This is very unfortunate because drug store face cleansers are hell for my skin and natural treatments have always worked except for this product. A waste of money.",2022-03-16 03:48:14.684711

It will be one of the deepest cleans you have ever gotten. If you have sensitive skin then don’t leave it on your face long!! If it burns a little, that’s normal and will go away after repeated use. Don’t expect moisture from the soap but it does it’s job very well. My face is testimony to how well consistent use will SAVE YOU.",2022-03-16 03:48:14.684711

I have been trying to master a beautiful clear skin regiment for so LONG. I was skeptical. But I just ordered this bar and a container of raw shea butter. When I tell you I have NEVER had absolutely clear skin I HAVENT until now. I almost can't believe it. I BARELY have to wear ANY concealer. I only do because my cheeks get rosey sometimes. This stuff is strong so you only need a small piece, lather in your hands like roll it around and then apply. Don't apply straight to your face because the soap might have shards in it. Then I pat my face dry and apply raw shea butter. A generous layer. And when I wake up if im good to go. Not only is my face absolutely CLEAR I saw immidiate results and my face is even beginning to be all the same tone. I cannot press how amazing this is!!!",2022-03-16 03:48:14.684711

This first week, my blackheads were gone within the 1st 48 hrs, then all the pimples & soon-to-be pimples popped up & I thought I was having an allergic reaction or maybe an adverse effect, but after the 1st week, my face is almost completely clear of acne & spots. I also use as a body soap as well. I wasn't too thrilled about the smell but it's growing on me. This is an absolutely amazing soap!

I rarely break out, the only time I break out is when my period is on, when I use a foundation that irritates my skin, or when I drink too much soda. So Aug 9 is when I received this product. I started using it on that same day. Everything was going well but then 3 days later I recieved a pimple on my nose and on my cheek. I heard that ABS can cause purging, but they said only on your hotspots, but I’m not acne prone so I don’t really get random breakouts. I don’t know if I’m purging or just breaking out....help",2022-03-16 03:48:14.684711
