It doesn't completely eliminate the problem but it does help.... A LOT! Heck, my husband is in his 40's and still deals with acne, especially on his back. He has a physical job and also works out a lot. His back tends to break out a lot more in the summer months due to the incredibly hot, humid weather here but he still has flare ups even when it's cold outside.",2022-03-16 03:43:55.212658

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"This my go-to body wash, whenever I sweat a lot after a good workout or even whenever my hormones are getting out of control. As some who has very bad, all-over body, cystic acne breakouts, I use this body wash almost every shower. It suds up beautifully on my pouf and doesn't have an odd, overly medicinal scent. Its formula is gentle enough to use all over, even on my sensitive skin, yet powerful enough to do what it needs to do. The fragrance is really gentle and nice. Ive been using this wash for a little over a month because my bacne was absolutely terrible. Surprisingly i have almost no bacne now. It’s 100% made a difference and my back is so much smoother i love it.",2022-03-16 03:43:55.212658

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I have actually used this same neutrogena product line’s face wash on and off since middle school and I’m now out of college. The face wash was great so I figured I would try out the body wash as well. I do get random bouts of acne on my shoulders usually during the hot summer months. I just got back from a trip to Florida and noticed I had a couple spots on my shoulders and chest and have been giving this a try. It doesn’t suds up a ton, it smells good, and you actually feel clean and stripped of oils or grime after you use it. I have noticed that it did seem to help turn some of the blackheads into whiteheads and also dried a couple of them up.",2022-03-16 03:43:55.212658

        TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,I received a 3 pack of the Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash and each bottle is 8.5 fl oz.  The expiration date is over 1.5 years from now. Each bottle should last you a decent amount of time because it is designed more for certain areas rather than your entire body.,2022-03-16 03:43:55.212658

B096PGRCPF,2022,3,16,6,Calming Wash,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2022",Roger N. Overton,,,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"When dealing with acne products, the two big names are either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. I find salicylic acid to be more gentle and less destructive of all moisture in the skin. This wash has been around for a long time and for good reason - it does a good job of helping to get control of and calming body breakouts. It can't stop breakouts all together, but it can certainly help. The wash feels good on the skin. It leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh without being overly drying. The scent has a clean smell to it, for lack of better words. This wash is a great choice helping tame acne prone skin. I like using a cloth or body brush with the wash for increased scrubbing power.",2022-03-16 03:43:55.212658

        TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I never get acne on my face, but sometimes I will have some minor issues on my back or arms.  So I decided to give this Body Clear Body Wash a try since I have had good luck with other Neutrogena products.  I have been using this body wash once a day for the past week.  So far I have not had any breakouts, so I think it's working.  But I will be certain after I have used it for a month.  This body wash contains Salicylic Acid, which is more gentle on your skin than Benzoyl Peroxide.  As long as you use this to prevent acne or treat minor cases, it works well.  But if you already have a severe breakout, then you will probably have to use something stronger until you have it under control.",2022-03-16 03:43:55.212658
