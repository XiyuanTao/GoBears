The first time I received the real thing: the same product I had tried and liked in hotels.  This last time I received an apparently authentic container filled with something that smelled and cleaned like a cheap drugstore shampoo. Smells and cleans nothing like the real thing.  At first I thought maybe the manufacturer had changed the formulation, but apparently that is not the case, as the real thing is still readily available at hotels and from reputable retail suppliers (though curiously now out of stock at many).  Very very very disappointed in Amazon.",2022-03-16 01:51:09.819756

        TOP 1000 REVIEWER",Verified Purchase,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I have used this shampoo several times in the past, ordering it right here on Amazon.  I sort of tripped over it when staying at a Hilton in Memphis, it was the shampoo they provided to their guests, and I liked it so much I ordered it again.  I have fine, (and sadly) thinning hair, and this shampoo does a great job of giving it a bit of a volume boost.",2022-03-16 01:51:09.819756

It was my first time being anywhere relatively outside of the U.S. mainland and it was also my first time traveling alone. I was there for two weeks and was on a mission to use as little money as possible. The only time I was able to shower was at the beach showers, which you obviously shouldn't use shampoo or conditioner at. I was pretty smelly and disgusting after sleeping on beaches for 2 weeks.",2022-03-16 01:51:09.819756

Doesn't seem to be like the hotel version this version I received was watered downed compared to what I tried at the hotel. You need to use more of it. Over all liked the product I tried at the hotel but wasn't to happy with what I purchased.,2022-03-16 01:51:09.819756

Having said that, forget flowers, forget chocolate, and if you must buy jewelry drape it over this decadence in a bottle. Can I just say my hair felt like such amazing awesomeness after using this. The smell is incredible to the point of eye rolling intoxication. You instantly know this not from a grocery store shelf. This belongs next to marble tiled floors and words like concierge and spa.",2022-03-16 01:51:09.819756
B005WKFHYC,2022,3,16,6,I've used it for years and it's minimized my scalp breaking out.,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2022",Paul,,Verified Purchase,,"I've always fought with acne on my scalp having tried several shampoos. The stuff that actually worked always smelled horrible and is usually really expensive or requires a prescription. The key for me has been to wash daily. If I skip more than a day, my head tends to break out. While this stuff isn't designed for acne relief, it's done a decent job for me keeping my scalp at a fair middle ground of not too oily and not too dry.",2022-03-16 01:51:09.819756

The last one was more runny and had no fragrance, one of the reasons I buy this product. It was replaced immediately, but the new one had the same lousy characteristics. Either the formula was changed or it was a bad manufacturing batch and the replacement came from the same batch. Either way, it is too expensive to try it again - I won't buy it again.",2022-03-16 01:51:09.819756
