Rinehart,,Verified Purchase,,"I know it says right on the bottle that this product is FRAGRANCE FREE which is why I am so angry about this body wash.  There is no need to lie about it.  I can find other fragrance free soaps, they are harder to find, but it isn't impossible.  Why Aveeno?!",2022-03-16 02:12:44.921369
B0009EILAS,2022,3,16,2,Life saver from itchy skin,5.0 out of 5 stars,76 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2018",hbrunner,,Verified Purchase,,"For the past 9 years I have had intermittent itchy skin that is not season dependent and unrelieved with scratching. It has gotten so bad, I have left scars on my legs from scratching so much. I have tried dozens of lotions and body washes including Cetaphil, Dove, Eucerin, Vaseline, CeraVe, Nivea, Suave, and other Aveeno products. Nothing has consistently kept the itching away until I found the combination of Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Body Wash and Moisturizing Lotion. With daily to every other day use, my legs have improved tremendously. I have chosen many products with no fragrance and oatmeal, but something about this combination has been a lifesaver. I will continue to be repurchasing these again and again.",2022-03-16 02:12:44.921369

Don't let that picture fool you.  If you were hoping that since the picture for the 18oz size shows the original formula bottle, that that will be the product you receive, save your time.  The 18oz size product is also the dark blue-capped, ""New and Improved"" formula, and it sucks.",2022-03-16 02:12:44.921369
B0009EILAS,2022,3,16,4,Best easy to find body wash without artificial fragrances,5.0 out of 5 stars,20 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2019",Big Jim,,Verified Purchase,,"We stopped using personal care products with artificial fragrance a few years back and it can be hard to find good options since most products contain ""fragrance"" or ""parfum"" in the list of ingredients. This is just a generic phrase that manufacturers can use as a stand-in for the actual chemical compounds that they use to generate a scent.  I guess it's to allow them to maintain their trade secrets or something. Anyway, once you stop using products with artificial fragrance, you start to really notice and hate the smell of any artificial fragrance.",2022-03-16 02:12:44.921369
B0009EILAS,2022,3,16,5,Very light natural fragrance,5.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2021",Josh,,Verified Purchase,,"Some have said that this does have a perfume, which is not actually correct. Perfume is artificial and can cause many skin irritations, but the smell in this is all-natural. So if you do not want any smell at all, this might not be for you. However, the smell is super light and refreshing (I hate most smells), and it doesn't stick with you after your shower. My sensitive skin feels really good after using this, and again, no smell that lingers with you which I love. The bottle is also easy to squeeze, which is a must. Great value and I will continue to purchase!",2022-03-16 02:12:44.921369
B0009EILAS,2022,3,16,6,The Perfect Body Wash,5.0 out of 5 stars,37 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2016",phillygrl,,Verified Purchase,,"Started using this a year ago when my husband was diagnosed with psoriasis.  He battled really dry skin before switching to Aveeno Active Naturals.  His psoriasis was starting to get really bad.  After switching to the fragrance free Aveeno his skin started to heal.  I know that this product does not make any claims to heal psoriasis but it definitely has helped his skin in our particular case.  He is not on any meds or creams and has not had any skin issues since last year.  My skin has also been so soft and moisturized.  With all of the chemicals in everything that we are using, it helps to go fragrance free for a body wash.  If this review has helped you in any way please let me know.  Thanks!",2022-03-16 02:12:44.921369
B0009EILAS,2022,3,16,7,Slippery with no Pump,3.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2021",P. Dean Robertson,,Verified Purchase,,"I wanted to like this product, had been shopping a while for a liquid shower soap.  Unfortunately, there are two problems that will prevent my ever using it.  First, the moisturizing quality of the soap also means that it leaves the floor of the shower terribly slippery.  Very dangerous.  Second, since my hands also got slippery fast, I had trouble grasping the bottle to pour out more soap.  This product needs to be packaged in a bottle with a pump.  Too bad but the general slipperiness makes it impossible for this old woman to use.",2022-03-16 02:12:44.921369

I love how it feels. There are only two things to watch for when using this oroduct;#1-it can leave the tub/shower floor a little slippery, so do be aware. #2-ive noticed that because of the Shea butter and other moisturizing ingredients it can build up in the drain. I had to use a drain cleaning product after about a month of use as it was starting to drain slower. But for me the benefits make it worth it.",2022-03-16 02:12:44.921369
