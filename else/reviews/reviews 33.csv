I would describe the scent as ""clinical""....it's not pleasant at all. Despite the offputting smell, I used the shampoo on Monday morning. I washed once and didn't get much lather, so I used a little more and washed again, then followed up with my usual conditioner. Once my hair dried, it felt very dried out, stripped, and stiff after using this shampoo, even though I had used my normal conditioner which always makes my hair very soft and silky. Not this time....it wasn't enough to combat the dryness this shampoo caused. It totally stripped my hair. (For reference, I am a Caucasian female with long, color treated brown, 3a/3b curly hair and I don't use heat on my hair...I even air dry it). To reiterate, I used this shampoo on Monday. Now this is where the story gets scary. I woke up today (3 days after using this shampoo) and discovered a BALD SPOT about the size of a dime located in the very center of my hair about 1cm back from my hairline.  It is VERY NOTICABLE! I have never in my life had a bald spot. My hair is not thinning, and no baldness runs in my family either male or female. So imagine my shock when my normally thick hair has a HOLE in it. The skin on my scalp is not inflamed or injured in any way, nor was my hair pulled out by me or anyone else....my hair is simply GONE.  I am not blaming my bald spot on this shampoo, but it is the ONLY thing I have done differently with my haircare routine for about a year. It could just be a coincidence, but it is a very scary coincidence. I have a Dr Appointment next week to rule out any medical issues, and if I discover it is indeed a medical issue, I will alter this review, because I do not want to be unfair to this product. However, I felt I had to share this story based on the chance that this shampoo might be the cause. I just want to save others from the mental pain I'm experiencing right now as I walk around with a large bald spot on the front of my head.",2022-03-16 01:52:17.650749

I would like to point out it’s a clarifying shampoo, not a regular shampoo, because a lot of people don’t seem to recognize that or know what a clarifying shampoo is so if you’re thinking you can use this everyday you’re VERY wrong.",2022-03-16 01:52:17.650749

I don't dry/straighten/dye my hair, it is not damaged . This was recommended as a good shampoo for hard water and it is AMAZING. My hair finally feels soft again after using it. I put coconut oil and argan oil in my hair instead of conditioner, and since using this shampoo it's actually able to absorb the oils instead of them just sitting on top of my hair. Anyway, highly recommended for people with hard water.",2022-03-16 01:52:17.650749
