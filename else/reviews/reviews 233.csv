Just plugged them in, stuck in 32gig micro sd cards, and they turn on every time the car is on. Very easy setup and it's just a matter of removing the sd card and copying it on my laptop, if I ever want to review a video. I found the controls and the tiny screen very cumbersome for any kind of viewing, but I wasn't expecting much from a $30 cam. The video quality is great for what it's supposed to do, just don't expect a cinematic experience. I suggest that you take the sd card out after first use, and check the videos just to make sure the cam is working properly. 32gig card seems to save about an hour and a half of video.",2022-03-16 05:46:50.137689
