B08L8W5FHT,2022,3,16,1,My steadfast go to for years.,5.0 out of 5 stars,13 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2021",golli-1112,,Verified Purchase,,"Have been using CG Outlast for years with various colors. Always Rosy is my favorite.  They stay on well, and leave some residual color even after eating. None of this class of long wear lip color lasts as long as they say, but these are affordable, long lasting (both in longevity of the tube as well as the color), and flattering. I’m 69 yo and have no lip “bleeding” with them. Great range of colors, too.",2022-03-16 04:11:25.201398
B08L8W5FHT,2022,3,16,2,Color true to picture. Stays on well,5.0 out of 5 stars,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2021",Melanie Smith,,Verified Purchase,,"I use the pool at the gym 6 days a week. I was looking for something that was essentially waterproof. This lip color is good at keeping the color throughout 2 hour sessions in the pool, steam room, and jacuzzi. There are two components: the lip stain and the gloss overcoat. The lip stain stays on like a boss. The gloss part needs reapplication after swimming ( big deal). All on all, I recommend this product. The price was reasonable too.",2022-03-16 04:11:25.201398
B08L8W5FHT,2022,3,16,3,Perfect for mask wear!,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2021",Laura,,Verified Purchase,,It’s all I’ve been using for lipstick since the mask mandate for Covid. It goes on wet and then dries so it doesn’t smear or rub off. It’s like a lip stain. Coat it with the clear gloss that comes with it for moisture. Stays on pretty much all day. You may need a touch up after eating or just add more gloss. I love the “wine to five” shade product no. 538.,2022-03-16 04:11:25.201398

In general, I love these lipsticks, but they are not moisturizing.  They stay on until you take them off unless you eat something greasy or oily.  I no longer wear any other lipstick but these.  The shipment arrived on time and was nicely packaged.",2022-03-16 04:11:25.201398
B08L8W5FHT,2022,3,16,5,Lips that hold it's color!,5.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2021",Edna,,Verified Purchase,,"This All-Day Lip Color with moisturizing topcoat holds up to its true product description. I bought this last minute hoping the shade and all day wear holds true and it definitely does. It is light weight, not heavy so it's a comfortable feel. The color is a matt silvery grape that stays forever until it's washed off with soap and water. The moisturizing topcoat was needed to keep lips moist with a sheen shine. Overall, this is a Good Product for those who are looking for this color and long wear. It came next day delivery, packaged very well. I recommend this product!",2022-03-16 04:11:25.201398

Most last a while but stain my cups.  My daughter turned me on to these and they are great.
