B071DXRDDG,2022,3,16,1,Not just for women...,5.0 out of 5 stars,63 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2019",Mike O.,,Verified Purchase,,"I'm a man in my 50's and I never thought I'd have to use any special soap ...just so it was soap.  I started having really dry skin especially on my arms, hands & legs and even on the back of my neck.  It was itchy.  I tried lotions that my wife bought but I just didn't like the creamy, oily feeling on my hands and my body.  It could've been the soap we were using that were strong scented soaps.  I've used Colloidal Silver for inner ear infections (swimmers ear) and even for my sinuses and it worked great so I thought I'd give this a try.  It seemed like it took several showers with it in order to start to notice a difference but I stopped itching.  It didn't leave a greasy, lotiony type feeling on me either.  I just felt clean.  It lathers up real good ...lots of foam.  So if you're a man that doesn't want to smell like you were thrown into a bath tub of rose perfume this is an option because it doesn't really leave a scent.  You just smell clean and that's what I wanted.",2022-03-16 03:33:52.067743

That's not why you buy the soap. This might be TMI but I get really really bad ingrown hairs to the point where they can infect an abscess. It's really been the Bane on my existence for the past 15 years. I use this soap on my bikini line area every day and let me tell you I don't get the problems as much anymore! I also put it on my back scrubber to help keep back acne at Bay! I don't know what else to say this stuff works for bad skin! Also, just so you know one bar will last you a very long time. It doesn't melt nearly as fast as the grocery store kind!",2022-03-16 03:33:52.067743
