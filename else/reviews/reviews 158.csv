I love the wand, the color, the packaging, the smell, the staying power, the way it feels on my lips. It is dry but it dries SOFT not hard and it doesn't cause my lips to shrivel up. I love this. I haven't shut up about it for 3 weeks. I have a drawer full of lip products and this k my favorite!!",2022-03-16 04:28:27.664225

Fahrenheim,,Verified Purchase,,"I have been on an absolute mission to find a lipstick, stain or color that simply stays put once on.  MANY promise this ... w/ 'smudge proof' or 'transfer proof' or w/ names like lip tattoo. However, I have yet to find that one that truly holds up to drinking, eating, and just generally going thru out your day w/ out having to reapply nor worry about looking ridiculous as part of it wears off (like the middle).  With this product, I even asked the community about long staying power w/ answers and verification it stays!  My experience is a resounding NO. It does the absolute usual- it does stay on possibly longer IF you don't eat drink normally. By normally I mean- after commute to work, the styrofoam coffee cup had lip prints on it. After eating lunch ( a Lean Cuisine pasta) I had to totally reapply as all that was left was bits in the middle of my lips. Out to dinner w/ friends, it, sure enough, wore off sipping wine :(.  Wiping mouth? Yup- appeared on the napkin. Sigh....search continues.The 'nude' color was easy to apply and did have a pleasant, almost slightly mint? flavor, but to me looked a little pink for a natural look.  Overall, yet another product that is nice, but certainly does NOT deliver that long lasting color as promised unless, hmmmm...you do little talking, eating or drinking and don't use a napkin. Needless to say, I most certainly exfoliate lips, use a lip pencil first, and let it ""dry"" beyond the recommended time :(",2022-03-16 04:28:27.664225

As a lover of pink, this was out of my comfort zone, but once I had it on with a black dress I felt gorgeous. This is one of those shades that I think would look stunning on anyone. The formula was soft with a little tingle, and great smell. Application was trying for me, I think it would have been easier had I had a matching liner, but it took quite some time to get a perfect line. I threw it in my bag for a long night out, nervous about it cracking or wearing off but even after 6 hours without touch ups, the rest of me was a mess but my lips were flawless.",2022-03-16 04:28:27.664225
B010RA4XFK,2022,3,16,6,Best lip color ever,5.0 out of 5 stars,19 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2016",Sarah DiSola,,Verified Purchase,,This is by far  my favorite lip product ever. I originally received a sample size of this in my monthly Ipsy subscription.  I found love with her instantly and ordered a full-size product.  I don't only love the beautiful nude shade but I love the formula itself. It does have a matte finish but doesn't dry out your lips and leave them dehydrated. It goes on smoothly and gives you full coverage in one application. The color lasts all day through eating and drinking and matches any outfit.  You can dress the shade up or dress it down it looks great regardless.  This is by far my favorite products and definitely a staple in my Beauty routine. I highly recommend the shade to anyone it looks great on all skintones. Go ahead and treat yourself you deserve it. This is my own honest unbiased review and I paid for the product with my own money.,2022-03-16 04:28:27.664225
