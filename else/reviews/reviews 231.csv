B074JT3698,2022,3,16,1,NOT REAL 4K... actually just 2K,1.0 out of 5 stars,"1,600 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2018",Jeremy,,Verified Purchase,,"I like the camera... as a 2K dash camera goes.  This is NOT a real 4K, it is using a 4MP CMOS that is artificially adding pixels to give you a 2K picture blown up to the size of a 4K.  It is no better picture quality than a 2K dash camera (which I already owned).  You should NOT run the camera at 4K@24FPS because you are just fooling yourself.  Run it at 2K@60FPS or pay the money to get a real 4K.  You can compare the video and you will see as I do that there is no quality difference (ability to read license plates at night) between 2880x2160 24FPS, 2560x1440 30FPS, and 1920x1080 60FPS (the pictures look exactly the same because they are really all the same lens resolution, but the 1920x1080 60FPS is a better video and you can read license plates *better* but no easily at night).  If this company was just honest I would have no problem with the camera... but false advertising and robbing ignorant customers is WRONG WRONG WRONG.  No stars for YOU!",2022-03-16 05:45:45.756019

And the ONLY one that is great!  In my opinion and basing it on the ones I have.  My first one was good, but low quality video, 2nd was 1020P video but crud night vision.  While the night vision on this one is good, it is grainy but you can still see details, could tell if someone hit you, or you witness an accident.",2022-03-16 05:45:45.756019

Chacon,,Verified Purchase,,"This camera is clear and it is easy to use once you get to know what each button does. I sat down and read the book that came with it way before using it so that I could get a good understanding of everything. The video provided is at default settings, so I haven't even set it to 4K yet and it is this clear. I do recommend the 128 Samsung 10 class u3 SD card for it as it records without freezing. I haven't had any problems, but if I do, I will post an update. So far so good though.",2022-03-16 05:45:45.756019

B074JT3698,2022,3,16,5,works great,5.0 out of 5 stars,863 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2018",Ted F,,Verified Purchase,,This is a great camera for your car. Small and easy to install and video quality is fantastic. The Car DV player is good but picture quality is better when played with the VLC player. I did have a codec issue with the VLC player and minor issue with sun glare (not the cameras Fault) and both issues were promptly responded to by the seller. Another nice feature with the VLC player is the ability to zoom in to read tags and things better.  I also use the motion detection feature to record when there is motion around the car when it is parked.  Have been using a Patriot 128 micro sd card and get about a months worth of video on it set at the HD mode. See attached photos. I would highly recommend car dash cam and the seller provides great support for any issues..,2022-03-16 05:45:45.756019
