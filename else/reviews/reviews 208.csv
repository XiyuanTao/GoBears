        TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"At $40 at the time of review, this lipstick is pricey but it’s also super classy and the tube screams quality. Or at least demurely announces it. The tube is seriously beautiful with a magnetic lid that literally snaps itself shut. The color was close to what I thought I saw online but it ended up looking slightly orange against my skin tone. I’m a medium light neutral skin color, primarily of Japanese and Mexican descent. The lipstick is creamy and I’d call the finish right between satin and matte. It’s not shiny by any means but it’s also not completely matte. The staying power is ok. It’s doesn’t last through any eating or drinking but it’s will stay in place if you leave it alone. The formula is creamy and smooth but slightly thin. You have to apply carefully to get it in an even layer. Just guessing by the finish, I think it’s better brush applied. I would buy this formula again. I just feel fancy and high class when I use it. I’d probably try another color in the future.",2022-03-16 05:26:52.531614

Smithe,,,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I love it. I chose Dusty Rose. My pic shows what one coat looks like an hour (and lots of conversation) after application.  It's an earthy pink and it glides on creamy smooth. My lips feel like they've got a moisturizer on. Amorepacific is my favorite skincare brand, and I've been eyeballing the Hera makeup line by them. I'm thrilled to have been able to try this incredibly expensive lipstick. Would I order again? No. It's too costly, I have another lipstick from an Indie brand that is also expensive but still less than this one. And it does the same thing for me (even has the same magnetic lid). So I'd reorder that one over this one. But I'll cherish this tube that I do have because I love the color, and it's been fun getting to try it.",2022-03-16 05:26:52.531614
