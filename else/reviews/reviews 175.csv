        TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I had to lower my 4 stars to 3 because the lipstick is already coming out of the tube. Not sure why - I've only used it a couple of times and normally. It was wobbly and when I turned the tube, the lipstick was definitely loose from the bottom and it's coming out so that over time, I'll not be able to push it up to use it without having the lipstick fall out. Too bad. I do like this lipstick a lot, but this one seems to have a defect in its construction.",2022-03-16 04:45:55.829597
