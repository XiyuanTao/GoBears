This face wash is gentle to my fragile, dry face.  I’ve tried many face washes since my battle with Seborrheic Dermatitis started and this is the one that works.  I’ve been using it for a year and don’t plan on changing.  Also, I had a problem with a shipment and the company responded right away and made it right.  I also love the Face Cream.",2022-03-16 03:19:17.127377

My trash bin is a graveyard of failed creams for seborrheic dermatitis.  I had given up, to be honest. I decided to give this one a try because I was having the worst flareup in over 10 years - my entire face itched and burned and the oil and scaling were horrific. This wash provided near instant relief. In 12 hours my redness and scaling have almost disappeared and my skin doesn't feel oily - even in the worst areas. This product is worth every penny",2022-03-16 03:19:17.127377

B015D6OKZG,2022,3,16,6,Worked Immediately for me,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2021",Bradley B.,,Verified Purchase,,"I was having a rash that was getting worst by the day, around my nose and above my nose bridge. I suspected it was the soap I had been using for some time, but in combination of the hard water in the new house we recently moved into. Immediately I noticed less dryness after first use of this product. I still continued to use other products I have been using for years to keep rash under control and it worked really well with this product. Highly recommend you give it a try to see if it works for you.",2022-03-16 03:19:17.127377
