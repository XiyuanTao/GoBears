B01NCLSUAV,2022,3,16,2,Satsuma Hand Cream always in my purse.,5.0 out of 5 stars,16 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2019",Heather,,Verified Purchase,,"Used to work for The Body Shop. They have quality products. Their scents are heavenly. Their hand creams are thick enough for my dry hands, but absorb nicely. Satsuma smells like tangerines and oranges- but not too heavy a scent that I feel bad using on a plane.",2022-03-16 03:17:36.720138
B01NCLSUAV,2022,3,16,3,Smells GREAT!,5.0 out of 5 stars,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2020",Jill,,Verified Purchase,,"I love the smell of shea! Very happy with my purchase. Some reviewers were upset about how much it cost for the amount of lotion you receive. The description is listed in the product details. It's a good price for a small bottle of lotion to keep in your bag or car. It is actually a lot cheaper then if you bought travel size lotion from other BIG name brands. Spend the $8, you'll love it!",2022-03-16 03:17:36.720138
B01NCLSUAV,2022,3,16,4,Overpriced but nice hand lotion,5.0 out of 5 stars,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2021",Fraulein Michaud,,Verified Purchase,,This is one of the 1st hand lotions I have come across that moisturizes without making my hands feel greasy. It’s way overpriced for the small little tube. This shouldn’t cost more than $3 but yet it does which means I probably won’t buy again.,2022-03-16 03:17:36.720138
B01NCLSUAV,2022,3,16,5,Not as good as hoped.,1.0 out of 5 stars,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2020",r,,Verified Purchase,,"The only redeeming quality about this product is the scent. It smells like yummy, sweet strawberries. Other than that, the product is TINY for the price and the product itself does not give any lasting moisture. I am so disappointed, I was hoping that buying a more expensive product would mean that the moisturizer was a better quality. After a few minutes of putting this on my hands feel completely dry again. I strongly believe you are just paying for the brand name here. You could probably buy more moisturizing hand lotion at the dollar tree lol.",2022-03-16 03:17:36.720138

B01NCLSUAV,2022,3,16,8,OLD PRODUCT! BEWARE!!,2.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020",user4536,,Verified Purchase,,"I bought this because I had previously used a freind's and LOVED it. The product itself is amazing. It smells really good and doesn't leave that weird greasy, slimy feel on your hands after using it. Keeps my super dry hands very mousturized, even now when I am constantly washing and sanitizing my hands. However, if you can, buy it directly from the store or on The Body Shop's website. I would not advise buying it on Amazon. There was no protective seal on it and the tube arrived squished, almost as if someone had used it before. And if that wasn't bad enough, the date on the back of the tube says 2018. That's TWO YEARS ago. I am not sure that I want to use the product at this point. If you can, just buy it directly from the Body Shop. Don't trust this seller.",2022-03-16 03:17:36.720138
