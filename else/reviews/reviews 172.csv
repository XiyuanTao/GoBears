I first put on lipliner and smudge inwards to eliminate a sharp line. Then I apply Lipchic which locks the liner on. Then I appt lipstick.  I personally prefer not to put on top of lipstick because as the day goes on and after eating when you reapply lipstick on top of the Lipchic it can become a bit dry.  Try it out though because it is a good product!  Been using for years.,2022-03-16 04:43:42.297008

I've tried them all and this is the only one that works.  If you eat a salad with dressing the oil may remove a bit of lipstick.  Just check your lips after lunch.,2022-03-16 04:43:42.297008
