Every day I mix this with the cerave fragrance free body wash and apply to my trouble areas, and I swear it’s working like magic. I’ve never been this happy with a product. It has only been a couple weeks though, hopefully it keeps working.",2022-03-16 02:48:05.302345

But it leaves a film instead of actually washing your face. Is it medicine ? How does one clean a face without a lather and the product just sits on top of the skin? To many questions.

If you've ever smelled old lotion before this has that smell. I don't know if I got a old bottle or what,  but it had my body smelling terrible. Then, it claims to exfoliates but I don't understand how when it has no type of exfoliating pieces/particles in it. Ultimately, I'm very disappointed especially at it's price point.",2022-03-16 02:48:05.302345

I was incredibly skeptical because I've been trying everything forever and nothing worked, but I figured...what's another product? Initially I was disappointed because it doesn't foam at all, so I didn't fell like I was getting a great clean. Turns out...I'd be pleasantly surprised. My back is the clearest it has been in 15 years! I'm so in love with this product, I've been using it for two months and continue to see improvement. I did have a breakout initially but kept with it and assumed it was purging and I'm so glad I didn't give up. I highly recommend this to anyone who has been struggling with body acne, give it time to work and you won't be disappointed. I only with it came in larger sizes, 4 oz runs out quickly when it's meant for overall body use.",2022-03-16 02:48:05.302345

Size too small for price,1.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2020",Lil Bit,,Verified Purchase,,"This has done nothing to clear the acne on my back. Literally no results what so ever. Actually, I'm having new acne spots appear while using this product. Not to mention the price in comparison to the size of the bottle. The bottle is small, more a face product size. $27 for a very small tube that's supposed to cover your back. How does that make sense. A waste of money in my opinion..",2022-03-16 02:48:05.302345

Absolutely no lather so you can’t tell if it’s getting to all areas of your back or not.  It feels more like a lotion than a body wash.  Saw no improvement in my acne.  Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.,2022-03-16 02:48:05.302345
