B00NU9MJYS,2022,3,16,1,This Soap Stinks!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,225 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2018",SesameChick,,Verified Purchase,,"After trying Mrs. Meyer's hand soap at a vacation rental, my family members campaigned for me to buy some for our home.  The rental provided the Basil scent, which we all loved.  I ordered 3-packs of that scent and 3 other scents, with the assumption that we would enjoy them as much as before.  These soaps are nothing like the experience at the vacation rental!  We all believe that these soaps at Amazon are some sort of knock-off made by a third-party contractor.  The soap does not lather, so you will tend to use more, and the scents are so off-putting!!! They are totally different from the original experience.  The four scents I ordered were--Rhubarb, Lemon Verbena, Basil and Bluebell.  They are listed from most disgusting to least offensive.  You're welcome.  The Rhubarb is a cross between raw rhubarb and dirt (NOT rhubarb pie), the Lemon Verbena smells like prairie grass after it's been in a heavy rain then the sun comes out, making it steam out a ""this is why I hate humidity"" smell.  The Basil has an herbal smell of some combination that should never be, and the Bluebell is a little too floral.  On a bright note, since you need to use more soap to get it to lather, you'll get through it faster, and maybe you won't have exposed all your friends to the abuse of the unpleasant odors.  They may question your tastes, doubt the friendship, and become scarce--it's that bad!!!  If you buy too much of it, like I did, you can save it for out-of-town guests that decide to overstay their welcome.  Out comes the soap, and voila!  Guests leave, problem solved!!  Thanks, nasty soap!!!!",2022-03-16 02:20:28.035827

My only issue with these hand soaps is the design of the pump. The old ones had an issue with the bottles getting all squished because no air would get in to take the soap's place. The new bottles do not have that problem but have an even worse problem; the pump part does not come back up after pressing it down and you have to manually pull it back up after each squirt. I don't know who designed these pumps but that is completely unacceptable and very irritating. I can't believe the company decided to redesign the pumps and didn't bother to test them before mass producing them.,2022-03-16 02:20:28.035827

This soap is like a miracle in a bottle for your hands! Mine are always dry and cracking, even with lotion I couldn't get relief from it. Since I started using this my hands haven't chaffed at all! My nails even seem healthier! I will definitely purchase again. Side note: Tried the pumpkin scent, it stinks. I mean it really stinks! And the stink stays with you for several hours..bleh! The Lemon Verbena scent is truly the best..",2022-03-16 02:20:28.035827

It's ridiculous how horrible the pumps are on Mrs. Meyers liquid hand soap are now. At first I thought my order was damaged in shipping but after the third shipment of Mrs Meyers liquid hand soap where the pumps are virtually unusable and I bought some at my local store I have figured out it is a Mrs Meyers quality issue. This is very disappointing as I love Mrs Meyers liquid hand soap but it is not the cheapest hand soap and now it is definitely not worth the money because the soap pumps don't work.,2022-03-16 02:20:28.035827

It was inauthentic or an authentic  bottle filled with mystery ingredients.  It smelled like old vegetable oil with a hint of the L’Occitane Almond fragrance that had gone stale or sour. The texture was pure oil, didn’t rinse off, and caused an allergic rash. Though it was listed as returnable, the seller charged $12 for a return and required a trip to UPS during the deadliest month of the pandemic. Amazon has tripled its profits over the last two years and can track every movement of its employees; certainly it has the budget and tech to better monitor fraudulent sellers or suppliers.",2022-03-16 02:20:34.590394
B001G60EK8,2022,3,16,2,I would just like to say that I absolutely adore this product,3.0 out of 5 stars,519 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2016",Peaboes,,Verified Purchase,,"PROS: I would just like to say that I absolutely adore this product. I've used it for 5 years now and it never gets old. I love it so much that I would not hesitate to purchase it again from a different vendor, or just l'occitane (hence, the 3 star rating). It smells amazing and lasts for a really long time. It's a very comforting relaxing smell and if you like the smell of almond, you will enjoy this product. There are very few beauty products that I'm willing to spend $25.00 on for an 8.4oz bottle, but this is one of them. CONS: I just wanted to warn others purchasing this, that your bottle should ALWAYS be filled to the brim. If you ever receive a bottle that is not filled to the top, something has gone wrong, and you should return it. A lot of people won't realize that when they receive this product UNLESS they are familiar with it. I just wanted to make sure everyone thinking of forking over $25.00 was aware.",2022-03-16 02:20:34.590394

Grotte,,Verified Purchase,,"Without sounding corny this stuff changed my life.  I've been using it for almost two years now and for approximately 35$ a year my dry skin is symptom free.  It didn't cure me, but not needing to apply moisturizer every day, not worrying about being in the shower at 5 degrees too high or an extra minute and feeling it for hours, that stuff is all in the past and it's great I don't worry about it anymore.  I recognize the price on this is high enough to give most people sticker shock, but you really don't need very much as it lathers really nicely.  I can milk a package of this for about 5-7 months, and the refill bottle lasts about a year or longer.",2022-03-16 02:20:34.590394
