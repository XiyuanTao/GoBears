Apply and let it sit a few minutes then use a fine tooth comb to gently scrape the glue off the lace. In most cases I can peel it off. Lather it real good and wash it right out.,2022-03-16 01:27:46.621598

It’s very inexpensive so I thought it was worth a try but I literally see no results and I still try using it on my clients after extension removal.,2022-03-16 01:27:46.621598

I started with this brands remover oil... let it sit over night than carefully brush through it to get chunks of glue out... than I used the shampoo and it really did work. Did it once and rinsed and than the second time I let it sit for 3 minutes fully lathered,2022-03-16 01:27:46.621598
