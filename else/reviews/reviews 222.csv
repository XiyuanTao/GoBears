B000H3EPV0,2022,3,16,4,Revlon is great for any lipstick junkie,5.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2015",Maekenna Walters,,Verified Purchase,,"Revlon hands down makes one of the best and affordable drugstore lipsticks available. I have yet to find a lipstick that isn't a stain have the awesome stay power this brand has. This color is a beautiful raspberry color. Perfect to complete most winter and fall makeup looks. The formula is creamy and smooth. The product has a very satin finish. One issue I have is if I forget to exfoliate before applying it can lead to bleeding without liner and can sink into your lip creases. But that's pretty much true for any highly pigmented, cream formulas. Absolutely love Revlon lipsticks. Highly recommend.",2022-03-16 05:39:03.310413
