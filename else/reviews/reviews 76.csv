At the time I ordered it, it was listed as a pack of 4 for $15.  Once I received one, I went back and noticed the page was changed to remove references of a 4 pack.  Now, as I'm looking for a new shower scrub, this pops up listed as a 4 pack again.",2022-03-16 03:04:13.756644
B002TSA90C,2022,3,16,2,Not what I expected...the AXE version is better.,1.0 out of 5 stars,18 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2020",Lion,,Verified Purchase,,"First of all I am disappointed that these are not eligible for return.  I purchased the 4 pack and only opened/used one of them the day I received them and am displeased with them but cannot return them (not even the ones I did not open).  These are not as good as the AXE version.,  the exfoliating side which is meant to be rough and abrasive is soft like the soft side of Velcro and is pretty much useless and pointless.  These are just smaller and much more expensive plastic scrubby poof ball thingys.  I wish I could give these negative stars.  I wasted my money buying them and am now stuck with a product that doesn't work for my needs and won't use.  I learned my lesson, I will not be buying anything from Amazon again that is non-returnable.  I should have looked at that before purchasing.",2022-03-16 03:04:13.756644

The scrubber is less abrasive, so I don't feel like I am taking the top layer of skin off washing my face. The sponge sticks out a bit more so I can get in behind the ears and around the twigs-n-berries. Very nice",2022-03-16 03:04:13.756644

B002TSA90C,2022,3,16,7,Manufacturing quality varies,4.0 out of 5 stars,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2020",Phil,,Verified Purchase,,"Overall, these are perfectly designed; pouf side is soft and sudsy, and the abrasive side is just scratchy enough but not too scratchy, and the rubber shell is easy for me to grip.  However, the most recent 4-pack I bought had two that were not properly stitched, causing the pouf to start to detach and unravel after just a few uses (unfortunate because even the good ones don't last more than a month or two of daily use before they start to deteriorate).  I'm going to try the Axe detailer again before I switch back to Dove, but overall I'd still buy these even if they're not always perfect.",2022-03-16 03:04:13.756644
