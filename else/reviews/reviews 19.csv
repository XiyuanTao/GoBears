B00UB6FT54,2022,3,16,1,Smells Fantastic!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2019",SmartShopper,,Verified Purchase,,"I have used many shampoos over the years and while there have been some that I disliked intensely, most have fallen into the ""it does its job"" camp.  This one by Nexxus does its job.  My hair feels clean and fairly soft after shampooing.  The best thing about this shampoo, however, is the fragrance.  It smells so good!!  Unfortunately, the price is pretty steep for a shampoo whose best feature is its fragrance although the bottle is good sized and lasted for quite awhile.  It's definitely a luxury buy and I'm not sure if I'll go for it again unless it's on sale.",2022-03-16 01:22:06.011660

I don't like it as much as Dove Moisturizing shampoo, which actually costs less.  The Nexxus doesn't suds up as well.  Yes, it cleans the hair, but it's nothing special, and it costs more than Dove.",2022-03-16 01:22:06.011660

I have baby fine, loosely curled hair that hangs a few inches past my shoulders. I no longer have color in my hair so I cannot speak for how it treats color. It does weigh my hair down a little bit--I use a more stripping shampoo once a week and that helps. But it is worth it to get my curl pattern back! The blonde was just limp and horrible.",2022-03-16 01:22:06.011660
B00UB6FT54,2022,3,16,4,Best Shampoo,4.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2019",Xiomara Lebron,,Verified Purchase,,One of the best Shampoos I have tried. Has a good lather and felt like it soften my hair while washing it clean and helped detangle my hair. Most Shampoos leave my hair with a big tangled mess and I have to add some conditioner just to get them rinsed out.  This Shampoo I feel like if I was in a rush I could bypass condition and still be able to run a comb thru my hair.  I would recommend it. The only down size and not by much is the price but it is a big bottle. Also love that it has a pump.,2022-03-16 01:22:06.011660
