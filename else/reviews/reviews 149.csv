B08MS77KPC,2022,3,16,2,A Fabulous Liquid Lipstick,5.0 out of 5 stars,41 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2021",Annette,,Verified Purchase,,"This is definitely one of the better liquid lipsticks I have tried by far.  I've been trying out so many of them since wearing a mask.  Most of them are awful-very drying and/or cakey, wear off too soon, all sort of problems.  This one is very nice.  I don't find it too drying, I won't go as far as to say that is not drying at all, it is slightly so, but not bad.  It wears very, very well, and I don't get a lot of caking on the inner lip with it.  It wears a long time, and I get very little to none wearing off on my mask.  I bought 006, Eyes on You, which is a nice medium neutral brown-but-not-too-brown, it has enough of a pink or some undertone to it to keep it from being brown.  And I have 009, Speak Up, which is a medium neutral pinky mauve, not Barbie or bubblegum pink by any means, just a neutral pink leaning warmer.  Both are very easy to wear shades that could be called Neutral shades to wear easily with most things.  I am sold on this formula, they did well with this.",2022-03-16 04:21:45.681878

        TOP 500 REVIEWER",Verified Purchase,,"Update: I bumped the rating up from 3 to 4 stars because this lipstick grew on me and I end up using it a lot. Like mentioned it is easy and not fussy to throw on, that’s what makes me gravitate towards wearing it often. The finish of the lipstick also grew on me (I was used to super matte dry finish) and now I don’t really mind it as much. I would recommend! I ended up getting multiple more colors, my favorite is “your go to” which is a beautiful medium neutral nude! I would recommend this to busy ladies and moms on the go!",2022-03-16 04:21:45.681878

I purchased Partner In Crime because I was looking for a pinkie-brown shade. This was not what I was looking for. This shade has some orange tinge to it. Unfortunately, I can't return it. Waste of money. Next time I'll be extra careful regarding return policies.",2022-03-16 04:21:45.681878

I bought two different colors, but only tried one because it only lasted as long as it took to lick my lips. It was not a color that stayed at all as the name implies. It simply wiped off with a tissue. I’m really disappointed in Revlon and I’m disappointed in Amazon for the no refund, even on an unopened lip color.",2022-03-16 04:21:45.681878
