B01KHSV0JE,2022,3,16,1,Best most flattering color:  Desert,5.0 out of 5 stars,15 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2019",AKN,,Verified Purchase,,"I now have two of these and am on the search for another mauve shade.  It's the formula that is the ultimate.  It's so creamy and smooth on the lips.  Never drying.  And this shade is an Allure choice.  I wouldn't have tried it otherwise, but it's insanely flattering on my pale face.  I avoid brown lipstick but this is different.  It's  like a dark nude, that's  not a nude, not a brown, but somewhere in between.  I don't do nude lips either.  This is my new daily wear shade.  If you don't know what shade to get and have medium to pale skin try Desert.  I wish I had found this one sooner.  It does more for my appearance than most other lipsticks I've worn.",2022-03-16 04:37:08.176756

Not orangish. And it’s very comfortable to wear and I don’t find myself having to reply very often. Also does not dry out my lips.,2022-03-16 04:37:08.176756
B01KHSV0JE,2022,3,16,3,Nice smooth feeling lipstick,5.0 out of 5 stars,13 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2019",Ton,,Verified Purchase,,I bought the colors Adobe and Vineyard. Adobe was a little redder than I had expected but I still like it. Will definitely wear both of them. Lasted about 3-4 hours before I needed to reapply and didn't last through eating and drinking. Feels very nice on my lips and smells good with nice shine.,2022-03-16 04:37:08.176756
B01KHSV0JE,2022,3,16,4,Too Bronze but Very Moisturizing,3.0 out of 5 stars,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2020",Amazoniac,,Verified Purchase,,"After looking at numerous reviews and color swatches on the internet, I thought the color, Dawn would be most flattering for my light olive-almost ivory skin and dark hair. I have attached two photos, one with the product and one without anything on my lips to give an idea of what the product looks like in natural light. Personally, I feel like the color is too bronze for my liking. I was hoping to find a nude-mauve color that gives you a “my lips, but better” look. Not the worst color, will layer with other colors but pretty nice for ~$4",2022-03-16 04:37:08.176756

Love this product.,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2019",Cocoanlace,,Verified Purchase,,I was buying this lip color at Target and for some reason they stopped carrying it. So I searched on Amazon and found it and bought three sticks of it. Absolutely love the color and it's so smooth and moisturizing on my lips. And it tastes good too. I hope Amazon never runs out.,2022-03-16 04:37:08.176756
B01KHSV0JE,2022,3,16,7,"Zero staying power, overwhelmingly fruity scent",2.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2017",Kindle Customer,,Verified Purchase,,"I bought this in Desert, and I don't understand why people say it's so pigmented -- I have to swipe it three or four times across my mouth to see any significant color.  It comes off immediately on anything your mouth touches be it a straw, a glass, food, skin.  If you're careful not to touch, it comes off anyway within an hour or so just from normal lip movement and friction.  And it smells very strongly of a fruity mango scent that I don't care for; I don't smell any vanilla at all.  Just a sickly sweet fruit scent.  I gave it two stars instead of one because disliking the scent is my personal preference, and it's a decent gloss. Just expect to layer it over a longer-lasting product, or reapply every 20 minutes.",2022-03-16 04:37:08.176756

Other nudes I have tried have been too brown or too dark or too pale or make me look washed out or like death. This one is perfect.  Color palette-wise I am a golden spring, blonde hair, blue eyes, fair skin but tans easily, this is the perfect neutral. And it is pretty good quality for a drugstore brand.",2022-03-16 04:37:08.176756
