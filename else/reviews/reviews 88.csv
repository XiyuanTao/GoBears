        TOP 1000 REVIEWER",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"This is an interesting bar of soap.  I got this because I have another soap of this Heavenly Life brand with Donkey Milk, and I really like it.  This soap is a pretty shade of light green, has straight sides, and smells really nice.  It is intended more for it's healing properties, as it uses Snail Serum.  New one on me, had no idea that the mucus/slime from snails was even used for anything.  Well, it's apparently been used for a very long time, is an ancient special formula ingredient that helps to repair skin and wound recovery, with superior healing.  It also improves the texture and appearance of skin, as in, an anti-aging look.  It is also recommended to use this soap as a 5 minute mask.",2022-03-16 03:14:55.732860

The smells pretty good to me. So far I did not feel any difference than other soap. So, the only downside is the price.",2022-03-16 03:14:55.732860

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"This soap is great!  It lasts a very long time.  Plus I like how soft it makes my skin.  It cleans well and doesn't dry my face at all.  I tend to have sensitive skin that get irritated by perfumes or harsh soaps.  This soap did not cause my any issues except that it did sting my eyes if I got it in them.  I do feel that the benefits of this soap in terms of moisturizing and anti-aging are true to an extent.  However, I did not see any skin regeneration or wound recover results as the soap claims.  But overall, I find the quality of what it does do superior to many bar soaps on the market and feel it is worth the price.",2022-03-16 03:14:55.732860
