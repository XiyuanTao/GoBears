Sodium lauryl sulfate is not in the listing as an ingredient, and I would not have ordered the bar if that ingredient had been listed here. My daughter does not share my sulfate allergy so I will see if she wants this shampoo bar. If not then I will ask for a refund because I do not dare use it myself.",2022-03-16 01:19:31.584971

I had minimal expectations for this bar but it far exceeded that! My hair is somewhat damaged form processing and I use product in my hair so after I was it still always feeds like some sort or resident is left behind on my hair. This bar made my hair feel cleaner that is has in a long time! Other than that it is super easy to use and lathers great! It smells good without being overpowering. My kids and my husband love it which I was completely shocked by!  I will most definitely be buying more!,2022-03-16 01:19:31.584971

I got this one for my boyfriend since it is a two in one.  Bamboo smells amazing and he loves it too. The scent could work for a man or woman.  It lathers up like crazy. I haven't used it on my girl hair because I'm convinced I need a separate conditioner so I tried something different and can't say how good the conditioning effect is for long hair but totally a winner on guy hair.,2022-03-16 01:19:31.584971

I was a little apprehensive at first because, I am used to liquid cleansers that suds up. I also have curly, dry hair and I hear some people say bar soap will dry out curly hair and make it frizzy. But, this bar soap, works really well. Its has a nice, soft scent that doesn't over power you and it lathers up way more than I thought a bar soap could. It leaves my hair clean and soft. No residue and stickyness. My curls look the same as when I used liquid shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner. Only now, I use one product, this bar soap, at a fraction of the cost and this is way better for the environment.",2022-03-16 01:19:31.584971

I wanted an alternative to bottled shampoo because I didn’t want to continue contributing to plastic waste and a product that has little to no chemicals BUT I also needed something that would effectively manage my dandruff. This was advertised as working for dandruff and it does NOT, to my disappointment. I would not recommend this product for anyone considering a purchase with that factor in mind. I was previously using a shampoo bar from No Tox Life which WAS effective in preventing dandruff by when I began this product it returned immediately. I will be switching back to No Tox Life for sure and sticking with that.",2022-03-16 01:19:31.584971

        TOP 1000 REVIEWER",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"This is a nice shampoo, but I wasn't wow-ed by it. I think the smell of the shampoo made me not fall in love with it as hard as I would have. The scent was a little weird to me and didn't smell ""nice"". It's not that I want a heavily fragranced shampoo but this one had a very light and strange scent, and after washing my hair it didn't have any smell to it. It did lather up pretty nicely with just a tiny little bit. I appreciate that it didn't weigh my hair down. I feel bad that I seem like the odd one out that didn't really like this shampoo as I've heard good things about it. Some shampoos just give me a great first use impression, but this one just didn't feel like it was anything special, especially given the higher price tag. I will give it several more tries to see if it gets better but as of now, it is not one I would repurchase.",2022-03-16 01:19:37.896030

        TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"The IGK Legendary Dream Shampoo was simply not legendary nor dreamy.  This was an average shampoo that didn't perform any better than most drugstore shampoos and that had a scent that smelled more like cheap cologne than anything.  The creamy white shampoo lathered up well, rinsed out easily, and left my hair feeling slightly stripped after use.  This is definitely a shampoo you will need to use with a conditioner as it will leave your hair feeling dry and staticky afterward.  The thing that bothered me the most about this shampoo was the scent - it simply didn't smell good.  The shampoo had a distinctive woody perfume scent to it.  It actually reminded me of those old medicinal Chinese soaps that my grandparents had decades ago - while it was nostalgic, it wasn't in a pleasant way.  At the current price, this shampoo was neither unique nor good enough for me to want to get again.  There are many other premium shampoos available on Amazon - this one was sadly a pass for me.",2022-03-16 01:19:37.896030
