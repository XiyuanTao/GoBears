It had the ingredients and directions written in another language. I wish they would stop passing off these fake products as the real name brand on Amazon. I recommend buying Dove products in store at like Walmart or Target because Amazon don‚Äôt really sell the real deal Dove ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòë,2022-03-16 03:34:49.186532

B06XZZWTL6,2022,3,16,6,Scent is terrible....,2.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2022",Liz,,Verified Purchase,,"I have used Dove products, especially Dove bar soap for over 30 years, even use it to wash my face.  I also use the regular Dove body wash which has a nice scent and moisturizes my dry, sensitive skin better than any other body washes I have tried. When I got this product it was obviously not a product manufactured in the US, had I believe Arabic writing and I would have used the product but the scent was horrible. It did not smell like any lavender and lemon verbina I have ever smelled. Total waste of money. A best business practice for companies is transparency regarding products, etc. Amazon should be transparent with customers and state in description the product was not made in US, etc. Customers then have the option to purchase an item which may differ in quality from those made by Unilever in US. I cannot believe the prices on some items sold on Amazon and I can't see anyone paying almost $100 for a couple of bottles of cleaning solution, etc.  which sells for a tenth of the price in stores or online from retailers. Unbelievable. What is the rationale for such a huge markup?",2022-03-16 03:34:49.186532

I love it.  It's light and not too strong or heavy. It's sudsy so you don't have to use a ton of it and waste it. It left my skin feeling smooth after I exfoliates with their exfoliating scrub in the same scent.  I consider it a gate way though, haha. I started with this and then I moved on to some that carried more of a scent! But I will be using this one. I also use it on my 3 year old and it did not irritate her skin, a plus!",2022-03-16 03:34:49.186532
