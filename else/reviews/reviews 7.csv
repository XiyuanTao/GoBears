B07VQBRLMH,2022,3,16,1,"Excellent formulation, awkward shape.",4.0 out of 5 stars,75 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019",Dustin G. Rhodes,"
        VINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,"I have been using this solid shampoo for about a month now. The actual formulation is really great. It is not drying or moisturizing and does not weigh hair down. It does exactly what it says it will do: volumize. The scent is extremely mild (and I typically avoid products with any fragrance) and pleasant. My only real complaint, and it's mild, is the bar itself: I hate the shape. Sure, it's pretty and it's fine to hold, but I don't think the shape is ideal to rub on your head. I MUCH prefer the usual round shape, which all other shampoo bars use. I am guessing someone designed this convoluted shape to differentiate it from all the others, but in my opinion this bizarrely shaped (although aesthetically pleasing) bar isn't an improvement. That said, I'd still recommend this low-waste, efficient, effective shampoo. I have tried quite a few of them, over a long period of time, and hands-down, this one is BY FAR the best.",2022-03-16 01:10:18.730004

It works great and lasts quite a long time. What I am not thrilled about is the fact that they wrapped my “plastic free” shampoo in plastic.",2022-03-16 01:10:18.730004

I’ve tried all the shampoos. Even YL and Monat. THESE DAMN LITTLE BARS HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE. Honestly. I now always have good hair days. I went two rounds with just the Volumize Shampoo and loved them. Now being it summer my scalp was actually getting a little dry from being outside all day everyday so I tried the conditioner. I honestly have always hated using conditioner bc I hated the way it made my hair so flat.... love the HiBar Volumize conditioner.",2022-03-16 01:10:18.730004

I have thin, very fine hair and many shampoos weigh it down.  Not this one!  My hair dries naturally with a bit of fluff, even without styling it.  A bar of shampoo takes a bit of getting used to:  I have to rub it around on my wet hair for a bit before I start getting some foam.  However, once I have enough on there, I get a nice, thorough clean out of it. I've been using it about a month now and I've only used half of a bar.  Good quality product and a great way to eliminate some single-use plastic from my life.",2022-03-16 01:10:18.730004

We have the conditioner too. As a hairstylist I can say that this product out does itself! My hair feels soft and clean after every use! I don’t wash my hair everyday (your not supposed to wash your hair everyday). I live in a place with hard water and I have colored hair.

My hair using all other shampoos would get greasy 24-28 hours later, with this product I don’t have to worry about it getting greasy for at least 40 hours, usually only washing my hair once every two days! It gets super sudsy quickly and leaves my hair super clean and glossy, my hair also gets super nice curls when allowed to dry naturally. Would 100% buy again!",2022-03-16 01:10:18.730004

The shape is awesome compared to bar-style solid shampoos, however the bar I got does not lather too well. I cannot help but wonder if we received an old or bad batch.",2022-03-16 01:10:18.730004

This is not the real stuff. My hair feels noticeably different. After washing and drying my hair there is a gross feeling as if I haven’t removed all the product from my hair. This was definitely replaced with tresseme or some other cheap stuff.,2022-03-16 01:10:24.250189
