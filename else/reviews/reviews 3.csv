My hair became flat and lost a lot volume and my hair appeared very thin. I was thinking of reversing the treatment by washing my hair with salts and parabens but decided to wait and wash my hair with this shampoo. I love the results! My hair are looking soft and shiny, and got volume back. Definitely recommend it! Will be purchasing again.",2022-03-16 01:07:11.710252

B01CTNRVFM,2022,3,16,5,Stinks! and Made in PRC which is China,1.0 out of 5 stars,111 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2021",Dempsey de Brazil,,Verified Purchase,,"I thought I would try this because of all the positive reviews. First off it’s made in China. While I don’t mind my scissors being made in China I do worry about products like food or let’s say shampoo being made in China. I decided to try it anyway because of the glowing reviews. The shampoo has the texture of slime and the smell gave me flashbacks of riding the school bus home with all the stinky sweaty kids. The conditioner smells like AquaNet hair spray (do they even make that anymore?) I don’t know how it was for my hair because I couldn’t handle the smell, have I said it stinks?, and rewashed my hair with my usual shampoo and I can still smell this stuff. It’s stuck in my noises.  Honestly I have never had a shampoo/conditioner that smells this bad. I have no idea what all the positive reviews are for. I’m going to try and return it. Usually I keep shampoos I don’t like to wash the dogs. Not this stuff. Even though I rewashed my hair I can still smell it and my hair feels like it has styling product in it. This stuff is terrible.",2022-03-16 01:07:11.710252

My hair isn’t frizzy, it is oily, thin, lacks volume, rather heavy because it is long, but I have a lot of hair. I thought that maybe this Argan oil shampoo will weigh it down, but on the contrary! I have volume and it adds body to my hair. Shampoo’s scent is my favorite so far, so luxurious, like a shampoo you’d get at a salon or a fancy hotel. The argan oil conditioner smells a little stronger but it does help to de-tangle the hair.",2022-03-16 01:07:11.710252

B01CTNRVFM,2022,3,16,8,My hair is pretty thin and I have to style it every time ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,135 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2018",Nina,,Verified Purchase,,"This shampoo is sulfate free and has argan oil in it, which signals premium, but the price is very affordable! My hair is pretty thin and I have to style it every time I wash it, so it is important to me that the shampoo makes it flexible and helps me avoid its natural tendency to curl when it's wet and then keep the curls while drying. So far it's doing the job and also filling my hair with nutrients + providing a healthy, full look. Recommend and will buy again.",2022-03-16 01:07:11.710252
