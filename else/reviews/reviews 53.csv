Not especially moisturizing for me but leaves skin refreshed & tingly especially with a navy shower. (Wet yourself, turn water off, lather up completely & rinse) It gives the lather time to detox your pores and feels incredible.",2022-03-16 02:24:13.241377
B07MPDH2CS,2022,3,16,3,Leaves skin feeling clean and smooth,4.0 out of 5 stars,17 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2020",Lauren Ferrell,,Verified Purchase,,"I’ve been using a dead-sea bar soap for a few years now. The one I was using cost $10 per bar, so I thought I would try this brand for $3 per bar instead. This soap leaves my skin feeling just as clean and smooth but for a fraction of the cost. I did have some drying/flaking for the first 1-2 uses but now my skin is used to it, and I also use a moisturizer anyways because I can have dry/oily skin. This type of soap has seemed to work beat with my skin- helping to clear up acne, doesn’t leave a weird residue, leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth, and doesn’t overly dry it out. If you are a fan of Dead Sea soaps, this one works just as well and costs much less. Doesn’t really have a smell; seems kind of neutral on that front.",2022-03-16 02:24:13.241377

Anyways, this is my new favorite soap. It has a fragrance that is very pleasant and not heavy or overpowering. I love how leaves my skin feeling healthy. I tried it on my face and hands and my skin feels smooth and not dry (my skin is normally dry this time of year so it's a huge relief). My sister and brother just started using it and as my sister was telling me about it I ordered it halfway through our conversation. She has skin issues with her face and when she came over to visit I noticed that her skin looked a lot healthier and less acne. When saw for myself how good it was for the skin that was all it took to convince me. Buy it, you wont be disappointed!",2022-03-16 02:24:13.241377
B07MPDH2CS,2022,3,16,6,My skin is SUPER oily and breaks out CONSTANTLY,5.0 out of 5 stars,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2020",Pearl,,Verified Purchase,,"I've been on ProActive for years now and I've been trying to find a product to get me off of it (I'm tired of not being allowed in the sun for fear of those liver-spot-looking dark spots, it's freaking expensive, and it bleaches my towels and pillow cases).  I've tried EVERYTHING and every time I come running back because my skin goes bananas.  Nothing has ever worked.  Until this.  I've been using it for a month now and this bar soap works.  My skin is still oily, but I have no delusions that there is any changing that.  I'm just so pumped that I'm not covered in giant blemishes and I'm not on ProActive!!!",2022-03-16 02:24:13.241377

This soap leaves you with a nice clean and smooth feeling. I have used many other soaps that do not clean my oily face very well and then it would result in even more acne developing on my face. This soap actually helps to clean my face and prevent more acne from coming out.,2022-03-16 02:24:13.241377

I like it and I use it everyday and it really helps with my skin. The only bad side about this soap is it doesn't lather very good. You got to keep using the bar of soap to get more suds. I wish they would make it to where it lathers up really good. But it does work good I will say. And yes I will keep buying this soap because it feels good on my skin..,2022-03-16 02:24:13.241377
