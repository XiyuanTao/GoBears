The only reason I cannot give this five stars is because the scent is supposed to be Vanilla & Lavender but there isn't even a hint of vanilla scent. Literally none.

This review is mostly on the most recent shipment we received of this product. As you can see from photos there was a pretty bad leak. I would guess maybe about 2 ounces of the product leaked out onto the box. As it turns out, one of the bottle pumps was loose and leaked. I’m not sure what the best solution is to keep from this happening again in the future, but it definitely required a little extra clean up upon unpacking.",2022-03-16 03:15:07.109003

I ordered Green Tea Lemongrass scent, however, it smells like orange. Not just a hint, it's a smack you in the face with righteous indignation ORANGE! For many, this is not a big deal, may even be awesome to feel like a major league pitcher threw an orange fresh from the tree at 90 mph that slammed right between your eyes while standing in the middle of a Florida orange grove. However, I detest the fragrance (also the taste/flavor) of oranges. Needless to say when my husband was decanting it into a smaller pump dispenser for our bathroom he was shocked that I purchased something orange, his favorite. I thought I could deal since it was open, and my orange aficionado husband was happy...and again, it was already open. I was wrong. The scent is not light. However, the nausea from the fragrance has really shortened my shower time in the morning and I am also much more alert as I am trying to keep my stomach settled. I would take off 2 stars for the fragrance (I have a true disdain for oranges) but the scent doesn't linger on your skin so since it's just 3-10 minutes a day in the underworld I kick 1 star. Everything else about the body wash is great, but it's hard to appreciate it while under olfactory assault.",2022-03-16 03:15:21.592700

The second ingredient listed is olefin sulfonate .  While it is not sodium laurel sulfate which is usually in soaps and shampoos, it is just as harsh.  This product is very hard on eyes and other sensitive areas.  I got a mild chemical burn in a very sensitive part of my body.  The smell is not anything like lemongrass.  It smells more like a combination of oranges and musk.  Not an appealing aroma at all.  This product does lather and clean well.  If it had been branded as a hand soap, I probably would have been OK with it.  But it is much too harsh for a body wash.",2022-03-16 03:15:21.592700

Amazon clearly does zero vetting on how products are advertised, so as far as consumer protection, you are still in the wild, wild west.  Buyer beware.  Only after opening, and noticing the weird way the liquid flowed did I check the ingredient list.  Sure, no sulfates, but saying that is totally misleading.  Cheap crap, worse than Suave shampoo.",2022-03-16 03:15:21.592700

I’ve been using dr.bonners soap for at least 35 years, probably more. I also used bio clean face wash. But..a year ago, I went online to buy those and realized I could no longer afford them. Distressed, I look around and found this one. Very scary, really, to buy an entire gallon of something I knew nothing about..  but, price was good, ingredients looked good so because Amazon has such a good return policy I decided to take a risk. When it arrived, I immediately loved the fragile smell. But I’m so sensitive to orders I worried the fragrance might stick to my skin and smell artificial..it didn’t. .  Right, so being happy with the fragrance and later with the beautiful feel of it, I still didn’t write a review because I was curious if it would start smelling ‘off,’. As dr. Bonners often does. Right, so I’m writing to say this gallon has lasted me one full year with no deterioration that I can ferrite out. And, I think I said, i really am very sensitive to that kind of stuff.  Long story just to say I just ordered my second gallon. Really good product. Thank you. I hope you don’t get so popular that your prices go up. 🥰",2022-03-16 03:15:21.592700
