B073DQSNR4,2022,3,16,1,It Leaves your Lips with a Lovely Rose/Pink Color,4.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2021",Susan L. Hawkins,,Verified Purchase,,"This lasts a very long time.  You could use it once a day, and then apply balms, glosses, or other lipsticks.  After they all wear off you would still have a rose/pink color to your lips.  I'm 63 and the pigment on my lips is not longer there.  Now, I wake up in the morning with color on my lips again.  You do not need to apply much of this stuff.  Thank you, Susan",2022-03-16 05:45:02.116361
