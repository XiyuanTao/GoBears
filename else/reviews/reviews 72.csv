B001E96L2C,2022,3,16,1,Contact Dermatitis and it has fragrance,1.0 out of 5 stars,6 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2020",CKamerin,,Verified Purchase,,This soap has been a complete fail for me. I was hopeful that fragrance free and for sensitive skin meant it would help with issues I‚Äôve had before however it seems to have caused contact dermatitis for me. After developing rashes I looked at the ingredients. It contains sodium laureth sulfate which is a known skin irritant (it‚Äôs used to make the soap foam up but it strips the skin of its natural oils). I would recommend avoiding this if you have sensitive skin. Plus the scent that it contains is actually quite pungent. More fragrant than soaps that don‚Äôt claim to be fragrance free.,2022-03-16 03:02:00.378047

However, I discovered several years ago I can maintain soft and non-painful skin if I use this at the end of my shower.  I have not found any other body wash or soap that works like this.  The scented washes have a lovely light scent as well.",2022-03-16 03:02:00.378047
