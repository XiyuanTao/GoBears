The print of the package is so unique and nice, the lipstick creates a smooth and moisture texture. The color I bought is CO128, which is coral red. The color is just right! Compared this with my YSL beauty lipstick, definitely go with this. The money is worth it! I also recommended to my other friends and they all love it",2022-03-16 04:20:31.146843

However, the quality control should be improved. The lipstick is touching the inside of shell and is already damaged even when it’s new. That’s the ever first time I got a new lipstick with dent on it.",2022-03-16 04:20:31.146843

B092HZV3B1,2022,3,16,4,Very nice lipstick with beautiful case!,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2022",CarolB,,Verified Purchase,,"I'm on a lipstick buying binge because, as usual, Clinique has retired yet another one of my fav colors. So, I'm branching out to other brands, and glad I did. These Catkin lipstick cases are just beautiful. Very aesthetic and makes you happy when you need to apply. I appreciate the lid and base being metal as they are magnetic and so eay to secure. You know the lid isn't just going to fall off or get loose. The only downside is when I finish the tube, what to do.... will HATE to just throw it away.",2022-03-16 04:20:31.146843

I especially love the magnet that snaps the top on, I wasn't expecting that (my toddler likes it too so I have to hide my lipstick now). This is going to be a repeat buy, and I'll also be trying out a few more colors eventually, I may have just found my favorite makeup brand.",2022-03-16 04:20:31.146843

They feel and look luxurious, and the shades are just perfect for my beige skin tone. I make sure to moisturize my lips and let them dry before putting any lipstick on, and I like the results with these. The set is the perfect gift. Buy it for anyone you know who likes makeup or simply treat yourself with it. You won’t regret it!",2022-03-16 04:20:31.146843
B092HZV3B1,2022,3,16,7,Just beautiful,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2021",spokanistan,,Verified Purchase,,"I bought the lipstick for the beautiful packaging. It is a plastic squared tube with embossed traditional Chinese art work on sides. One side does say catkin. The tube also has a magnetic closure which is really nice. The lipstick itself has beautiful carving on it. It turned out to be a soft warm red color (not orangey) very similar to what was super popular in the 90's.  Velvety smooth feel, matte but not dry, and no weird smell or taste that I could tell.  It is a regular lipstick, and does wear off after time/ eating/ drinking, but leaves a subtle stain.  I absolutely love the artwork and it looks great/ expensive on my vanity.  Planning on getting more colors.",2022-03-16 04:20:31.146843

So I was excited to get this new color CP126, since I needed a PINK color. The color is not as shown on the lips of the model or picture...it has a slight reddish hue.  Very disappointed of the color, it does last on the lips and is not drying. HOWEVER,  I DID NOT WANT another reddish hue...money down the drain on this purchase.",2022-03-16 04:20:31.146843
