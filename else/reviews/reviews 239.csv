Why buy a dash cam if I need to enable the camera on my phone? Why do you need my location when I’m not using the cam or the app, why do you need my mobile #? Why do you need to send me notifications constantly. I’ll pass, sending back this big brother in a box.",2022-03-16 05:49:31.826341

Well, wouldn't you know it, it worked great for the first month, then I noticed it would intermittently work the next month.  Yesterday, I was hit when an idiot decided to pass me on the right and cut in front of me, and the camera failed to capture any of it, just when I needed it most.  Will toss it and get something rated better.",2022-03-16 05:49:31.826341

It claims to be automatic. But it doesn’t ever actually save drives. Just the route. Why would I buy a dash cam to save the route I took? I want it to save the drive. I don’t want it to delete. I want it to save every single second until the memory is full and overlaps. Big scam energy. God forbid I actually got into an accident and I was counting on footage to save my ass. I’d be absolutely screwed!!!! (EDIT: everyone saying that all footage is backed up onto SD CARD IS LYING!!! There is nothing but bits and pieces of random sections of my drives!!!,2022-03-16 05:49:31.826341

Turns out, the camera will turn off on its own after a certain amount of inactivity. It also turns on and records on its own, but it usually doesn’t start until about 5 minutes of driving. Nexar says they’re working on that. So far, I’ve remembered to turn it on most of the time.",2022-03-16 05:49:31.826341
B07ZPGSKLS,2022,3,16,6,Great Phone Features and Hands-Off Approach,5.0 out of 5 stars,40 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2020",Isaac Lopez,,Verified Purchase,,My wife and I had a couple of dash cams and we hated having to take the memory card out and download the videos. We wanted something we never had to touch and would sync with our phones and this device covered every base. It does ask for a lot of phone permissions so if you're the type that values your privacy heavily this may give you some unease. However my wife and I are OK given the features and the hands-off nature. You can keep your phone in your pocket or purse and the camera will record no problem and if something was to happen you can go back and save a specific clip or it will also automatically record hard brakes or accidents.,2022-03-16 05:49:31.826341

This one is the the most expensive one I bought so far and it has been worth every penny. As far as installation, it was very easy to stick it to my windshield with the suction cup. I loved that it came with cord clips to tie up the cord around your car. I spent a good 30 minutes stringing the cord throughout my windshield and under the passenger seat so the cord wasn't in the way when I am driving. As long as it has a power source, it turns on when the car turns on, making it very worry free.",2022-03-16 05:49:31.826341

Usually dash cams save all footage on a memory card but this one saves all footage on your phone making it really easy to access any footage you might want to check out. It’s easy to install and the wires are easy to hide. The quality is very good when it’s recording and your able to see the license plate of cars in front of you.,2022-03-16 05:49:31.826341
