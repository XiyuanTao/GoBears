B08SCGPG6J,2022,3,16,1,"Expensive, but pretty nice",4.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2021",Ashley P,,Verified Purchase,,Overall I like this body wash. It has a light scent that is not overpowering or super sweet like other body washes I've tried. I've also had body washes that leave a film/residue on my skin but I dont notice that with this one. My only reason for docking a star is because it's pretty expensive for only a 5oz bottle.,2022-03-16 03:37:29.376697

First off, it smells divine with strong citrus overtones. It's a gel that goes on smoothly and lathers up to a light creamy texture. It feels so soft on the skin. As it rinses off, my body feels smooth and hydrated.",2022-03-16 03:37:29.376697

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"It's alright... but I probably wouldn't get it again, basically because the bottle is sooooo small for $15. It's only 5 ounces. This is the size of bottle that some of my face washes have come in. It isn't going to last very long when you are using it all over your body. The smell is a bit like citrus. I didn't research this brand so I don't know if it's some fancy brand that is well known or not. It's nice to have if you want something natural and gentle without harsh chemicals but I'm probably just going to go back to my Dove or Caress bodywashes.",2022-03-16 03:37:29.376697

I will say a little goes a long way, and it lathers nicely, but I donâ€™t expect the bottle to last too long. It smells nice and the smell lingers a bit on the skin after washing.",2022-03-16 03:37:29.376697
