I have always liked the Buxom brand for lip products, but I have been searching for the shade Dolly for a few years now. I first found it at an outlet mall in Williamsburg VA and never saw it again. Finally came across something very similar with this lipstick in Dolly Dreamer. It is full coverage, goes on smoothly, looks great. Not drying at all and feels very smooth. I am going to order as many shades as I can now! Reasonably priced, too.",2022-03-16 04:39:47.409784
