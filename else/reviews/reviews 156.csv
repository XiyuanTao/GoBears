B09167GXBB,2022,3,16,2,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2021",Maria,,Verified Purchase,,i was looking for this type of color and product and i am in Loveee¬†with the color after using it. I am medium skin toned and it looks great on my skin tone but i think it would look great on fair and dark tones too.¬†I used it for a day and it stayed well. it does transfer to other things like your glass or napkin but it doesn't¬†come off the lips and you don't¬†need a touch up right away.it does fade out eventually but still it doesn't fade out completely and still look good without touch up. and still if you want to refresh it Just¬† one touch up will outlast the day so you won't¬†be using it too much. It's cost effective too in that sense and I think it's already reasonably¬†priced.i will definitely buy other shades tooLip Glossy has¬†a little shine as its name applies to natural shine and that's what I wanted. it's not overly glossed or sticky. Gloss brush is soft and applies smoothly.matte lipstick is of creamy texture and it moisturizes my lips.it doesn't¬†dry my lips as other matte lipsticks do nor comes off in flakes.i'll recommend buying it. am SAtisfied :),2022-03-16 04:27:10.946613

Wow, the color smudges onto everything your lips touch. It‚Äôs a very nice color, I‚Äôll give it that, but the main thing I was looking for was for the color to not transfer. It transfers BIG TIME! üò© üíã",2022-03-16 04:27:10.946613

Green,,Verified Purchase,,"The quantity of the product and the quality of the product is good.  On my monitor, the color appeared more as a deeper nude color.  When on, had a bit of underlying orange than the brownish pink I anticipated.  It could just be due to my skin tones.  The color is saturated, so very good coverage.",2022-03-16 04:27:10.946613

The feel of the lipstick was nice, not a tight feeling, like some lipsticks can feel like. I do wish the wear lasted longer, which I get is a sacrifice when you pick a non-matte lipstick. I definitely think I‚Äôm going to buy another shade as overall, I was really happy with this purchase!",2022-03-16 04:27:10.946613
