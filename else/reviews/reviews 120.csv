I miss this fragrance for my after-gardening shower. It used to put me in a magical state of mind. Peaceful and lovely. Like my garden.,2022-03-16 03:38:16.833483

I would like to find the spray in the same scent but don't see it. Presuming the other reviewers are mistaken I can say what I've received multiple times was very pleasant but I can't truly compare to the store item.,2022-03-16 03:38:16.833483

We used it to relax her hand muscles and it was always her choice when 2 other options were presented (she was non-verbal).  I still love this scent now that I'm retired and have moved away from the town where I used to work.  To me, it's a beautiful scent, but to others, it may be ""awful"".  Everybody's olfactory (sense of smell) is different.  Sometimes Bath and Bodyworks scents can be overpowering.  This one was not!",2022-03-16 03:38:16.833483

The scent is off. It also doesn't seem to give the amount of lather as past bottles of this that I've had. This is the first time I have purchased this through Amazon instead of at the box store. I will buy at the actual store next time just to be able to check the smell to be sure they haven't changed the formula. It smells watered down or like a cheaper product quality.,2022-03-16 03:38:16.833483

It smells like the scent that your great aunt who has fluffy pink toilet seat covers and wreaths with dollar store sunflowers around her house would love. I asked my husband what he thought of it after getting out of the shower and he told me it smelled ""better than his morning breath."" I'm sure there are people out there who like this smell, but it is not attractive to me.",2022-03-16 03:38:16.833483

So glad it was available.  The only thing that doesn't seem quite right it the cap. The snap up to push the bath wash out does not open as it should.  I have to unscrew the top each time I want to use it which is not convenient in the bath with wet hands.,2022-03-16 03:38:16.833483

I figured I would try to look for it on Amazon. Turns out it's wayyy cheaper to buy on here than on the Bath & Body works website. Came perfect! Mother was happy!,2022-03-16 03:38:16.833483
