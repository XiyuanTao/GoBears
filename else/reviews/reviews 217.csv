The color is a very nice rosy brown, and I think it strikes a nice balance between pink and brown. However, I agree with the other reviewer that it is definitely darker in real life than it is in this photo (which is either good or bad depending on your preference).",2022-03-16 05:32:57.706048

I believe I had the Rose color a few years back and I lost it unfortunately. I just ordered the Rosewood and it has no scent at all. The tube seems thinner as well.
