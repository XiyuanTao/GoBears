You will never need any other lipstick. I have the clear one Je Ne Sais Quoi which goes on clear and then changes to your perfect color AMAZING and now this Rose Flush.  Best lipsticks ever!!  Moisture and no transfer of color ever! Ordered by my wife.  She is obsessed by these lipsticks and highly recommends to her friends.,2022-03-16 05:02:04.383193
