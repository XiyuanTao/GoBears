B08LCQYW3R,2022,3,16,1,Worst product I've ever purchased on Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,6 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2021",Kayla,,Verified Purchase,,"If you have sensitive, itchy skin, possibly with allergies or eczema, this is NOT for you. You likely avoid scented products because they might irritate your skin. But this product isn't even lightly scented; the scent is so overwhelming I almost threw up in the shower. I had to exfoliate afterwards and rewash my skin to get this gross stuff off. I threw it away after one use. I'm not even going to bother asking for a refund. WORST PRODUCT ON AMAZON!",2022-03-16 02:23:53.686678
