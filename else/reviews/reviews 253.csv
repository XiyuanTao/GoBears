        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I was really excited to use this device seeing that it gives you Android 9 in your car and all you have to do is own a vehicle with wired CarPlay to use it! The setup was really easy just plug it into your CarPlay USB, connect to it via Bluetooth, and youâ€™re all set. You donâ€™t need a 2018+ car, as I did it with a 2017 and it worked fine! Onto the device features, it very much is android 9 down to the core with a skin on top. Most apps will run pretty smoothly like YouTube and Hulu for instance but Iâ€™ve noticed that Google Maps is incredibly slow and I usually have to force close it to the point where I ended up going back to CarPlay in general as it was just taking too long to load map data. Thereâ€™s split screen which is super useful though if you want to rock Google chrome and Netflix or YouTube. The browsers run fine, not too slow and not too quick. I think for the asking price the devices should be able to get a cpu or ram buff to handle more demanding tasks like maps as it really shouldnâ€™t take that long but in general this device is pretty solid for everything else! Itâ€™s cool to have a fully functional version of android in your car!",2022-03-16 06:12:20.435232

VERY good for this price!",5.0 out of 5 stars,97 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2019",Robbie Ferguson,,,,"At $30 this dash cam is surprisingly good. The features like G-Sensor, wide dynamic range and night vision are really impressive at this price. And to boot, I'm very impressed with the picture quality. It came with a good long cable which will be easy to tuck around the edge of the window to hide it away. It starts recording immediately when the car is started, and the ""parking mode"" is neat (to automatically start recording when it sees movement while the car is parked). See my video for the full review with sample footage (daytime).",2022-03-16 06:12:27.256231

Eyre,,Verified Purchase,,"This thing is fantastic! I already got a guy blasting by me on the right hand side on an illegal pass, running a stop sign, improper passing, and all of that allowed me to get his license plate on video so that the cops could run it later on and find out it was canceled. Speaking of cops, I have one of those guys on video making an illegal pass in a no passing zone with no emergency lights activatedâ€¦ This thing is hysterical fun! The amazing amount of weird stuff that you catch people doing on video is unbelievable. The video is really excellent here, and the audio from the camera picks up whatever you say on the spur of the moment, so just watch yourself when you start seeing strange stuff. ðŸ¤£",2022-03-16 06:12:27.256231
