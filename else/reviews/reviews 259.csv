Easy to use, adjustable. Bought it for my 13 Ford F150. Mounted camera to the rear license frame. Went through automatic car wash several times with no problems. Wide angle lens has reduced blind spots significantly. Bought it as a test to see if I liked it, price was reasonable, and quality appears to be excellent. Will be purchasing 2 more units to install in my C5 Corvette and my retro Thunderbird. If you install it in a pickup or larger vehicle you will need an wiring extension kit which is available. Customer support through Amazon and Dudubell very helpful. Yes, I would recommend this produc",2022-03-16 06:26:03.412977
