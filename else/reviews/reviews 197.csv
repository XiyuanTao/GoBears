It doesn’t look like “frosty rose with tangerine undertone” (for whatever that means anyways). It looks more like a “hot tomato sauce with pasta undertone” shade...my photo doesn’t bring it across quite right, but perhaps that’s the entire issue: This shade may be difficult to convey accurately via photos. Have to throw it away - unfortunately $17 spent for nothing.",2022-03-16 05:16:06.924157

I knocked off stars because I was hoping that the color wouldn't be as orange and it was VERY orange. I was hoping for some reddish tint in there since the photo depicted a sort of burnt sienna-is color but it was too orange for my taste. With that said, I'm willing to try a different color - wish me luck!",2022-03-16 05:16:06.924157
