B09BYWYQHS,2022,3,16,1,Pretty good,4.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2022",Mya,,Verified Purchase,,"This lipstick was pretty cute, I mainly bought for the packaging but I actually like the color. It was supposed to be more red but it came out orangey red when lightly applied. I am not mad about that. If u want the shade Bright red & you are expecting a bold red then you probably shouldn’t get this one and maybe try Coy or any of the deeper red. Shade: Bright red. I would recommend mixing this shade with Peripera Ink airy velvet lip tint in shade 04 Pretty pink. They pair together well, and the only con to this lip is the easy removal. It stays if you dont eat, drink, wipe mouth even lightly, and stuff like that. Besides that this is really cute and I like the bottle",2022-03-16 05:07:56.345751

Ollmann,,Verified Purchase,,"Purchasing this lipstick has taught me not to buy lipsticks on-line, unless it's one that I'm already familiar with.  The two colors that I purchased both ended up looking very orange on my lips. Not at all the look I was going for. I basically threw my money away on something that i won't use and can't return.",2022-03-16 05:07:56.345751

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"It's just the perfect sheer matte bullet lipstick formula. A single layer goes on perfectly evenly, despite my having rough lip texture. It doesn't require any extra futzing around with blotting or blending or extra layers to look perfect, unlike most ""blotted"" lip products on the market. The color is pretty durable and the powder matte finish isn't overly drying.",2022-03-16 05:07:56.345751
