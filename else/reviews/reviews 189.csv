B073HK7G5V,2022,3,16,1,My very favorite lipstick of all time,5.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2021",SunnyBrook,,Verified Purchase,,"This light silvery neutral pink ""lights up"" my face and leaves a light pink stain when the finish wears off so that I can go through a casual day without having to reapply.  A gloss that can be carried easily in one's purse would be the way to refresh when you are out and about.  That's because the one drawback of this product is that it is sensitive to heat and quite delicate, so you would not want to jostle it around in a purse. It is exceptionally moist and luscious.  The color L56 ""Rosy Pearl"" is the perfect color for me.  I have a fair to medium complexion and I generally avoid bright or dark colors.  If you want something that has slightly more color, you might choose Champagne.  I use Champagne when I wear brighter pinks or reds that call for a bit more lip color.",2022-03-16 05:11:18.191402
B073HK7G5V,2022,3,16,2,This color is fabulous!,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2022",Laurie,,Verified Purchase,,It’s hard to find a good lip color without seeing it in person. This color just WOWS! It has a little bit of a peach/rose gold color to it with such a great shimmer that it’s almost like a metallic. Very elegant and my very favorite new color! I am a blue-eyed blonde with a ruddy complexion and this color is just incredible. Stays on and feels so creamy. I just ordered a second one because when you find a great color you need to purchase more in case it sells out!,2022-03-16 05:11:18.191402

It’s more nude than peach so it’s pretty over anything neutral I think. I am glad I purchased it. I would not wear it alone but if you had full lips it would be beautiful,2022-03-16 05:11:18.191402
