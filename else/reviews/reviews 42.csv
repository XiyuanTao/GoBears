B09BP297TJ,2022,3,16,1,Does the opposite of hydrate—it irritates skin,1.0 out of 5 stars,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2021",Stephanie G.,,Verified Purchase,,"This product is advertised as something that “hydrates and soothes skin” — it completely dried me out and I was itchy afterwards. I use tea tree & eucalyptus in everything for 15 years, it is my go-to scent for all things body, hair, face, creams. None if the other 50+ products I’ve used has dried me out. I have to return it for the smell alone. It is distinctly odorous like a dry scalp shampoo coal smell. It is not pleasant & after my shower I smelled so…distinct that I had to re-shower with another soap to wash off  & mask the smell. The purpose was to soothe & hydrate skin, which is does not do. It also claims to work on athlete’s foot & cure up some tougher ailments: this might work for you in the way a terrible smelling dry scalp shampoo will work…it does clean & bc the smell is so bad I’m guessing it could help with really tough odors.",2022-03-16 02:17:05.002475
B09BP297TJ,2022,3,16,2,Excellent Product,5.0 out of 5 stars,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2022",gary,,Verified Purchase,,"For all the ignorant reviewers who do not know what Tee Tree and Eucalyptus oils smell like, buy yourself a couple small 1oz bottles, and stop leaving the uneducated reviews. They both have a scent similar to Turpentine. The reason for using them in this product is not for their wonderful fragrance but for the antibacterial and healing properties of both. I work construction and am required to wear safety gear, hardhats with liners and a lot of other work related items which take a tole on my skin and scalp. This product has cleared most of my skin, scalp and nail problems with the first bottle. I just put some in a washcloth and scrub the effected areas lightly - leave it on for a few minutes and rinse it off. You can decide by using what works best for you. It is working great for me and my second bottle is on the way. if you don't like the Turpentine smell buy a 1oz bottle of your favorite smelling oil and put some in. It's not rocket science it's medicine for your scalp, skin and nails.",2022-03-16 02:17:05.002475
