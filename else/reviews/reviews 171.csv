The fact that it's a click lipstick means you only use what you need and can prevent you from accidentally breaking it. The quality of the product is really good. This is now one of my favorite Korean brand of lipsticks.,2022-03-16 04:42:49.824964

B07CGCS1RG,2022,3,16,3,My Girlfriend Loves It!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2020",Joon,,Verified Purchase,,"I bought this I'M MEME Tictoc Lipstick Satin for my girlfriend, and she loves it!! It has a unique design that reminds me of a mechanical pencil except for the fact that the lipstick moves very little by each button click, which totally makes sense because if it would move a lot by each click, it wouldn't be easy to put the lipstick back. Also, its tip has a very unique heart shape, which is fun and a perfect shape for a gift. She also mentioned that it is easy to use and extra soft. Absolutely satisfied with the quality of the product and will definitely buy it again!!",2022-03-16 04:42:49.824964

Not only adorable but it also makes easy to apply on the lips. You can just line your lips with the tip and fill in the rest! It is nicely pigmented and lasts for a long time without drying out my lips! It is creamy and velvety but has overall matte look. Very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend!!,2022-03-16 04:42:49.824964
