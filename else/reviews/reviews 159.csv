B0946PB9PB,2022,3,16,1,Not as vibrant as in the picture,4.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2021",A.May,,Verified Purchase,,"I was expecting a vibrant & bright pink & orange, but the colors are much darker than I expected. The pink is more burgundy & the orange is more of a warm nude. They're still very pretty & pigmented so I will use them. They just aren't exactly what I was looking for. One thing I really like is that the liquid lipstick component pops out completely so you don't have to carry the whole case.",2022-03-16 04:28:43.124715

I don't have to worry about the cap of a lipstick tube accidentally falling off in my pocket or anything. The matte colours are great, too.",2022-03-16 04:28:43.124715
B0946PB9PB,2022,3,16,3,Like a novelty lip cream,2.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022",Jisbo,,Verified Purchase,,My first impression is that it feels a bit cheap like a child’s toy. It’s very light weight when I swatches it on my hands the colors bleed easily and looks very the same. Not bad for the price and cute packaging. It will definitely transfer onto anything touching it. Feels more like a lip stain. After scrubbing my hands with soap it left a pretty ugly red stain :(,2022-03-16 04:28:43.124715

When you try to pull them out the lipstick is stuck in the bottom of the container and not in the tube. You cant get them out and you wasted your money ..Buyer beware,2022-03-16 04:28:43.124715

They are very matte and feel nice on the lips. My only issue is that they are slightly different than the advantages colors. The lighter shade of the one I ordered (blend and green packaging) is more orange and a bit lighter than in the image. I would still recommend though!,2022-03-16 04:28:43.124715
