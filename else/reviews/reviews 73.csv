B003B6FFNC,2022,3,16,1,Beautifully natural product! Awesome price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,14 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2020",Reyna,,Verified Purchase,,"This is my favorite body wash/ hair wash for the babies and I. We have very sensitive skin and have tried many soaps and body washes, this is the best one, it smells great, the lavander scent is natural so it actually smells great and not like the artificial smell you usually get from other products that are not completely natural. Itâ€™s very moisturizing and does not strip your skin off itâ€™s natural moisture. Also the soap is natural soap from shea butter so its not irritating on delicate areas. I also use it for shaving and itâ€™s the best! Their price is awesome for the size of the bottle, best part for me though is that this company helps out the communities where they produce their awesome products! Check it out, itâ€™s worth every penny. Please donâ€™t change your formula. We really appreciate that there is no preservatives or anything unnecessary in this product. Thank you Allafia, and all Amazon Sellers, and of course Amazon for your service, God blessðŸ¤—",2022-03-16 03:02:12.370875
B003B6FFNC,2022,3,16,2,A Modern Mans Body Wash,5.0 out of 5 stars,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2020",Royer,,Verified Purchase,,"Hereâ€™s how I came upon Alaffia. Honestly, it was the distinctive graphic design on the bottle. Then the sale price at Whole Foods in a big bottle of shampoo. Bought the 32oz bottle of coconut shampoo at Whole Foods. Didnâ€™t work out for my hair and wasnâ€™t too hot on the fragrance. Instead of tossing the bottle, I started using the remaining shampoo as a body wash. I started to notice some big differences in my skin within a few days...no more dry skin, dry feet, or body breakouts from acne. All of this a big deal since I have very sensitive and reactive skin.",2022-03-16 03:02:12.370875
B003B6FFNC,2022,3,16,3,Doubles as Plant Cleanser!,4.0 out of 5 stars,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2021",Krystal Cordova,,Verified Purchase,,"Now I KNOW people are going to probably come for me BUT I found this soap to double as an EXCELLENT plant leaf cleanser!!! The first ingredient is NEEM which for avid planthusiasts, is a necessity for fighting off pests that arise. The fact is also, neem oil is best used when you mix it with some sort of soap to help it bind together to spray on your leaves. I was desperate one day to clean my dusty leaves and figured that this organic formula is actually PERFECT as long as you dilute the soap with lots of water. I used one tiny pump with lots water and mixed it in a spray bottle onto a microfiber cloth. This concoction worked BEAUTIFULLY for getting the job done and I havenâ€™t gotten any pests since then. My leaves are so shiny and beautiful and since taking off that layer of dust on them, they have been growing faster as thereâ€™s nothing impeding them from  receiving ample light. I do believe the original version is best for this HACK since we donâ€™t know how the essential oils on the other options are going to react to your plants. As far as a body cleanser, it is nice however I still prefer something with SLS from time to time to get rid of grime and a little funk from the underarms. I usually have something strictly for those CREVASSES (play on words thanks to Tenacious D, IYKYK). Hope this helps yâ€™all!",2022-03-16 03:02:12.370875

Its become may favorite part of my bedtime routine, I swear I donâ€™t sleep as well without it. I usually buy it at Walmart but theyâ€™ve been out of stock lately so I turned to amazon, I also decided to try some of their lotion and face wash, both of which really like as well, but the face wash was a different scent than was advertised ( described as coconut and neem, arrived as papaya and neem) I was pretty disappointed because I really like coconut but my skin seems to like the soap and the smell is refreshing and spa-like. Unfortunately two of the three bottles arrived with broken pumps. All three bottles were just thrown in a box with absolutely no packaging so zero stars on the packaging. 3 stars on description accuracy, 5 starts on scent amount and quality of the products themselves.",2022-03-16 03:02:12.370875
