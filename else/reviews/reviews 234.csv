Very Satisfied,5.0 out of 5 stars,465 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2016",Fabio Bonnett (Sao Paulo - Brazil),,Verified Purchase,,"After doing a lot of research on the internet, I decided to buy the Rexing V1 due to its size and due to the fact that it comes with an adhesive mount. I don't like suction cup mounts because they tend to fail over time. I hard-wired the unit to my car so that whenever the ignition is on, the unit will be powered.",2022-03-16 05:47:12.780520

Most of the time when you seen a front/rear collision, it is often automatically assumed that the rear driver is at fault. However, in this case, it was not and this dash cam is my only proof of evidence. I installed this dash cam myself back in December when I purchased my car and wired it myself. It wasn't difficult and I was able to conceal most of the wires. Anyway, there's tons of reviews here that elaborate on the product, so I encourage you to read those.",2022-03-16 05:47:12.780520

After setting it up in my vehicle I proceeded to download the mobile app and everything went downhill from there, the mobile app is horribly sluggish, it freezes, live video stream is just a black screen which takes very long to load. Many crashes of the app later I was able to get into the settings and it it just froze and crashed once more. Also the list of features are not correct, it says it has parking mode BUT once you read the manual it says that in order to use the parking mode feature you must purchase an attachment which is not included with the camera. I was very hopeful and excited about this camera, but I ended up returning it, it was a BIG disappointment.",2022-03-16 05:47:12.780520

I purchased this for my son for his birthday in March.  Yesterday he went to the beach and someone hit his car and left the scene just leaving a note sorry I hit your car backing up and a phone number.  We were able to look at the dash cam get a plate and provide the video to the police!  With the footage we were able to know she hit him 3 times backing up!!,2022-03-16 05:47:12.780520
