B078J6ZRPY,2022,3,16,1,"A SEXY, DANGEROUS COLOR!",5.0 out of 5 stars,12 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2018",Christine Paris,,Verified Purchase,,"A little bit darker than I thought, but I LOVE IT!  This is Loreal with a lipstick makeover.  The color is a beautiful dark greige with a hint violet underneath, almost imperceptible, it s a very hard color to describe, but it fits with jeans, it fits with going out on a date, it is great without any other makeup.  I really love that way it can look punk or rock and roll or high society.  I collect millions of lipsticks, and only have about five that I really like and wear.  Its so subjective, and everyone has a different view on how their mouths should look and what color, so you have to take a few chances, but this is so good, you have to try it.",2022-03-16 04:39:15.574029
B078J6ZRPY,2022,3,16,2,This is an awesomely cool shade if your skin is cool toned,4.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2021",DLS Jones,,Verified Purchase,,"This is an incredibly unique shade that borders on a grayish purple but it’s such a cool grungy look for any age person.  The only thing I don’t like about Loreal lipsticks is the perfume they insist on including in their formula.  I’ve actually avoided Loreal lipstick for a very long time but this limited edition X Balmain shade was just too tempting to pass on.  This is a unique shade that is a combo of gray/violet and brown.  But it’s not a really really cool toned brown and it’s not gray either.  It has just enough purple to be super flattering on my cool toned skin.  It wears “pretty” well, not the best and not the worst.  I wish it was a truly matte formula since those have a much longer wear time, no matter the brand.  I wish someone (smart) on the Loreal lipstick team would make a proposal to just take out the perfume.  No one WANTS perfume in their lipsticks.  Yes, some can live with it and are fine if there is perfume, but honesty, I don’t know a single person that would honestly say “oh yeah, gotta have perfume in this, no doubt about it.”",2022-03-16 04:39:15.574029

Looks dark khaki on lips (not really olive)— unless you were to neutralize lip color first. But it’s not worth that much prep work, because it does not last.  Coverage is patchy as well, and it has a tendency to bleed because the formulation is so soft. It’s a shame, because the shade could compliment many skin hues.",2022-03-16 04:39:15.574029
B078J6ZRPY,2022,3,16,5,"Smooth, but too perfume-y",4.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2018",Risetta,,Verified Purchase,,"Just received the color Fever and it's really pretty. It goes on smooth, maybe too velvety smooth since that usually means it'll fall right between the lines of my lips and it did. I can correct that with a lip primer, however, this has a particular smell to it. Reminds me of lipsticks I used to play with as a child. I absolutely loath perfume scents on my lipstick, smells cheap and not sure what kind of chemical they used in it at this point. Oh well, price of beauty!",2022-03-16 04:39:15.574029
