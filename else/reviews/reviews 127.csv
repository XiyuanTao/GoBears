B09BZYTRRV,2022,3,16,1,Very sensitive skin. These were great. Magnolia doesn‚Äôt smell as strong as the pomegranate.,4.0 out of 5 stars,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2021",Amazon Customer,,Verified Purchase,,"I don‚Äôt normally like exfoliating body wash but thought I‚Äôd give it a go after an eczema flair up. I‚Äôm super sensitive to dyes as well as artificial, drying soaps. I tried both snd neither caused an issue. I used to love their Rose body wash but my local stores no longer carry it so I thought the combo would be nice to try. The Pomegranate Mango exfoliating body wash doesn‚Äôt have those annoying super thick granules so I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe it‚Äôs a natural exfoliating mixture without the tiny granules. Definitely smelled stronger than the Magnolia but not in an overpowering way at all. The other is just much more subtle so I will probably stick with the Pom Mango or alternate when I need some exfoliation. My eczema flare up has calmed down after using these soaps. I wanted to try something new bec I got tired of repeatedly using the Tea Tree (which is great for soothing tired muscles and such) and the other options just didn‚Äôt compare to the smell of these with the exception of the Rose. So I will continue buying the set. It‚Äôs a great deal to get two in one delivery. I recommend:)",2022-03-16 03:46:10.174138

The bottles are huge , it lathers enough for your whole body in 2 pumps. The only reason I took off a star is one of the bottles came damaged and the pump won't twist open so I have to wait til Im done with the first bottle to try the 2nd one. [Sometimes I like to switch it up but oh well] but the one I tried had a very pleasant smell that doesn't linger.",2022-03-16 03:46:10.174138

They were shrink wrapped in some plastic, but the plastic had a couple of holes in it and the smell was really strong and really bad. I did not even remove them from the shrink wrap. I just boxed it back up and returned it. There is no way I could have that horrible smell on my body.",2022-03-16 03:46:10.174138
