Just one application of this daily in the morning keeps my face clear.",2022-03-16 02:27:51.779007
B00YSZPLFW,2022,3,16,2,Immediate improvement,5.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2021",Sofia M. ,,Verified Purchase,,"I developed a rash on my forehead about 1.5 years ago and have also been struggling with breakouts and facial redness. My dermatologist diagnosed seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea. I’ve tried prescription creams like Metronidazole and Azelaic Acid, as well as OTC hydrocortisone with limited results. Within two days of using this wash in combination with the DS foaming gel cleanser, the rash is completely gone. My forehead is no longer red and scaly. The rest of my face looks less red and irritated, too. Even breakouts seem to have calmed down. Hopefully this will last, but for now, this is the most effective treatment I’ve come across.",2022-03-16 02:27:51.779007
