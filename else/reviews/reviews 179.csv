Slightly different color than the one advertised, but that's alright. Dry, neat finish. She sipped a glass of water, and the lipstick did not run off at all. No weird smell or anything. Very light, and great quality. Just be sure to exfoliate your lips (like with a moisturizing lip sugar balm) before application.",2022-03-16 05:02:52.794917
