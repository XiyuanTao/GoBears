It does everything I want it to do and more. I can watch videos, listen to music from spotify and Google play music. I couldn't be more happier.",2022-03-16 05:50:56.015408
B07HR9Y6DC,2022,3,16,2,Android head unit with customer service to back it up!,5.0 out of 5 stars,31 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2019",Nathan,,Verified Purchase,,"Decided to purchase this unit over others based on other feedback about their customer service. I mean, Amazon backs up purchases anyways, but didn't want to deal with that hassle of returning in case it didn't work out. Well, really happy with the unit. I have a dodge ram 3500 and always wanted a backup camera. This worked out great, turns on the camera automatically, has settings to turn down the sound so you can concentrate. Radio app works great, the Bluetooth/phone integration works with the ability to download the contacts book onto the unit so you can dial people by name. Still working on google integration for google assistant. I chose a full up android unit instead of one running android auto because I like the adaptability and the option to run torque with a Bluetooth adapter.",2022-03-16 05:50:56.015408
B07HR9Y6DC,2022,3,16,3,Not all parts required included be prepared to spend extra cash,4.0 out of 5 stars,29 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2019",HK,,Verified Purchase,,Worked great in my 2009 Chevrolet Avalanche only issue is that this stereo is large and long so it does not go in the dash flushed it sticks out about an inch but i have no issue with it stereo looks great all functions work great. Also did not give 5 stars due to having to buy almoat another $100+ on wiring harness steering wheel control module etc could have been more but i did not get the better harness that includes door chimes and warnings i use to hear my turn signal click now i don't but i do not mind. Module was about $60 for steering wheel controls which is annoying that this stereo did not come with it but advertises it has steering wheel controls and that is not true that you have to buy seperate. The wiring was not as easy either took several hours i got the largest stereo frame kit and had to sand it down to fit the stereo it is very large long ways and the front facing as well. Took all day to install and make sure i had all to install. Other than that stereo works great i love it takes a minute to start up but connect automatically to my wifi router and cellphone or tablet easy fast switch i can run YouTube and maps at the same time i get notifications for hangouts just as on my phone basically a tablet on my car so i love it.,2022-03-16 05:50:56.015408

Half the apps don't work right, can't delete or disable the bloatware. The amazon ad very distinctly touts easyconnect but it when trying to connect to my phone it says the app was downloaded illegally. I tried to delete it and reinstall it but the Google play store says it's not compatible with this unit. I had a choice between a cheap Chinese knockoff and this but I decided to spend a couple extra bucks on this. If I would've known this is a cheap Chinese knockoff too I would've saved myself the extra 70 bucks.",2022-03-16 05:50:56.015408
