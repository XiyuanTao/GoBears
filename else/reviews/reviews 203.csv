B01CH28VZ4,2022,3,16,1,Helpful to protect lips with Argan oil and high spf,4.0 out of 5 stars,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2020",Diana D,,Verified Purchase,,The color of the lipstick is hard to tell from the photos so it is hit or miss ...until you find a color you like. However the lipstick is a good moisturizer and has a high SPF. The Aryan oil also helps to keep lips from chapping. This lipstick is more of a gloss and does not last long..so be aware you will need to reapply often. I like this product for the healing it has provided and have ordered again.,2022-03-16 05:24:14.404619

B09RV4KBCW,2022,3,16,1,Beautiful Long Lasting Colors At A Very Reasonable Price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2022",Tina Lee Johnson,"
        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I was excited to get this lip stain set as I had read good reviews about it.  It comes with six different colors with unusual scientific names such as:  Beakers, Vials, Flasks, Condensers, Distillation, and Test Tubes.  They arrived in a plastic bag and were each in their own little box.  The bottles inside are cute little nipple top bottles, but the top is not a squeezable dropper type.  The applicator wand inside(attached to top), is just the right size with an angled sponge tip.  I found it very easy to apply with precision.  I tested all colors on my hand, and the color Flasks on my lips.  It didn't say how long it takes to dry, so I gave it a good 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes I applied water(as it said it was ""waterproof""), and smeared it a little.  There was some bleeding of color, but after wiping off the excess that bled, there was still a substantial stain left.  I did the ""blot test"" on a tissue and only a small amount of color came off my lips.  When I tested it by drinking from a straw, there was no transfer at all of color.  I even licked my lips a few times and ate something and most of the stain remained on my lips.  I even used soap and water on the colors on my hand, and five out of the six colors remained.  I am VERY PLEASED with this lip stain set.  It has beautiful long lasting colors at a VERY REASONABLE price!",2022-03-16 05:24:25.185919
B09RV4KBCW,2022,3,16,2,Wow!,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2022",Christina,"
        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,Iâ€™m actually pretty impressed with this liquid lipstick. I didnâ€™t know what to expect since it said it was and also waterproof. It arrived super fast. Each lip stick is packaged individually and the packaging is really cute. They look like little droppers but the bottle is glass the top is not silicone itâ€™s like a hard plastic. As you apply those it feels liquidy and creamy and a little thick. But it doesnâ€™t take long for it to dry down. It is true to color and it doesnâ€™t dry down to that hard dry grainy feeling like other matte lipsticks do. Itâ€™s almost like a stain. It is for sure waterproof and I could hardly get it off with soap and water. I really like the set I like the variety of colors and I would definitely recommend it.,2022-03-16 05:24:25.185919

B09RV4KBCW,2022,3,16,4,Difficult to apply evenly,3.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2022",Sierra Gentleheart,,,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I don't know why this set is listed with the term ""nipple bottle"" listed so prominently. The applicator is a long, oval spongy tip like most doe foot applicators for liquid lipsticks. The stain is hard for me to apply evenly. I can grab a tube of lipstick and apply evenly with a refined edge in a second, whereas this liquid lipstick goes on thick in some areas and thin in others. Once I get it smoothed out evenly and it has dried, it is okay, but it's more like a stain. My dry lips are soon begging for some kind of soothing layer to keep them moisturized. That pretty well defeats all the effort I made. So, for me, these are worth 2.5 stars at best.",2022-03-16 05:24:25.185919

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I'm really not sure what to make of this matte lipstick. It goes on really wet and thin.  I felt like I needed to keep applying more and more to my lips but that didn't help. Once it drys, if you rub your lips together, any extra product on your lips rolls up and looks like dead skin on your lips. I was not fond of this at all. It does stain your lips though. I had to scrub it off with a rag with soap and water. I would have to apply gloss over this to make it wearable and that defeats the purpose of it being a matte lipstick.",2022-03-16 05:24:25.185919
