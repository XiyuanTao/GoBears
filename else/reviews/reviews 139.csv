Like, aside from the shipping packaging they were shipped in from Amazon, they were in a manilla envelope. With such a high price tag for 3 little things ($74.99 at the time of writing this review), I expected something more in terms of packaging.",2022-03-16 04:11:53.411371

        TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I was perplexed as to why this Essence of Argan set was $74.99. It must be AMAZING, right? I got the Teaberry lipstick, Pink Bronze lip gloss, and the mascara. No fancy packaging here. Just three sealed items in an envelope.  I prefer simplicity and quality to fancy packaging so that didn't bother me at all. The lipstick in Teaberry is much lighter than I expected. It is almost a nude shade with a bit more pink to it. It's creamy and applies like any other lipstick. The gloss in Pink Bronze is pretty. My pics don't show the metallic looking gloss too well. Not much pigment so it's good for a little shine alone or over matte lip colors. It wears off fast even when I don't eat, drink, or talk. The mascara is pretty good for an everyday one. It adds some length to my lashes and doesn't clump at all. It isn't a messy mascara and can be layered without any issues.",2022-03-16 04:11:53.411371

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"This makeup set comes in a very simple plastic bag which was not something that I expected specially compared to the price! They have 6 different sets and I ordered ""Teaberry Lipstick, Pink Bronze Lip Gloss, and Mascara"" which includes of one mascara, one lipstick and one lip gloss. The lipstick is very nice nude-pink color but mostly like a nude shade with cool undertone and nothing like what you see in the swatch pictures. The lipstick has shiny/oily finish look and it's not very pigmented. The lip gloss is nice with the same undertone as lipstick. The mascara is in black shade but gives you very natural look as it doesn't have so much volume or lengthening effect.",2022-03-16 04:11:53.411371
