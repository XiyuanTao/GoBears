Super moisturizing & feels great on my lips, not too sure it will be “long-lasting.” The first picture is right after I applied, the second picture is after blotting on a tissue (get some of the shine off).  Love it!!!",2022-03-16 04:44:29.241042

Thought with it claiming certified organic ingredients that it was a non toxic product.  However, one of the ingredients is phenoxyethanol and every site describing that ingredient list it as ""toxic"" ""carcinogenic"" and one site even states that it should not be used around the lips or where it might be ingested.  Now I have two tubes of this product that I have wasted my money on and will have to dispose of..",2022-03-16 04:44:29.241042

This lipstick is so creamy even on my super dry lips and it does last. I have tried other natural lipsticks but this one takes the crown. Ill get other colors!",2022-03-16 04:44:29.241042

I got sweet pea and it's super hard to find a frosty pink lipstick and even harder to find it cruelty free and Leaping Bunny Certified, which is all kinds of wonderful. Well I'm thrilled with it all. I love love love this frosty pink lipstick. It's a lighter shade, which I don't wear dark colors well at all, my lips are thin and small so dark shades just do not look good, to me anyway. So I've always wore lighter shades, leaning towards the pinks in general. Hard to find and it being cruelty free is even harder, but I won't buy and will do without frosty lipstick if it's not cruelty free and now oh boy I don't have too. This fits the bill in every way possible, feels wonderful, looks wonderful and wears great. They're stuck with me. I even ordered and got the Jicama color which is light frosty tannish color. Oh golly I think its wonderful too!! They are stuck with me!! Love this friendly company.",2022-03-16 04:44:29.241042
