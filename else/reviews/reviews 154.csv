        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I ordered this lip gloss in shade ""Pink Bronze"" which is a very light pink-nude shade in the picture but in person it barely has any pigment. The applicator is nice and point so you can easily apply it on your lips. I think it mostly looks like a clear lip gloss with a little tinted into it so I wouldn't use it alone but it's nice to be used as a last layer on top of your lipstick so it adds a little shine into it. The quality is nice and it doesn't make my lips sticky and it's very light weight on lips. I think it's a little pricey as there are so many affordable lip glosses that are very similar to this but way more cheaper.",2022-03-16 04:24:48.341911

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I was a little confused by this product listing which said my color was ""matte"" but it showed up shiny and with sparkles and I really didn't want to try it. That being said, it's not really super glossy or sticky on my lips but just adds a bit of moisture and shine, and just a touch of color. Much better than I had assumed when I saw the tube.",2022-03-16 04:24:48.341911

It's okay but made my lips look wet, shiny and a bit oily. The description page says: ""This long lasting and bright lip gloss makes your lips look wet and sexy.""  I felt like my lips looked more greasy.  I like the feel of this, especially when my lips are dry and chapped but I am not a fan of the VERY shiny oily look.",2022-03-16 04:24:48.341911

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I like this gloss, but I wish it stayed on for a little bit longer, or at least that it was more moisturizing. It doesn’t really have a color which is exactly what I wanted, but it’s very thin and mainly feels like I’m wearing a teensy bit of oil with a ton of very fine glitter on my lips (although it doesn’t look like I’m wearing straight up glitter, so don’t worry about that).",2022-03-16 04:24:48.341911

I love the color which is more natural and transparent than some other types of gloss. Feels great on and doesn't leave a sticky feeling. Overall, its great and i would order it again. The only downside is the current retail is around $25 which seems a bit steep for what you get.",2022-03-16 04:24:48.341911

Is it matte? Is it glossy? Can't tell by the description. Well, in fact, it's a very moisturizing, not much different from standard, slightly pigmented lip gloss. Certainly not worth the double digits it's currently priced at.",2022-03-16 04:24:48.341911
