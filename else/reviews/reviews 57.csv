B00DRE5I26,2022,3,16,1,Impressive results!,5.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2020",Stirlady,,Verified Purchase,,"I’m so impressed with the efficacy of this product! I’ve developed these eczema types patches on my arms that would get aggravated after shower and for a long time, I suspected it was the body wash I was using. Through research, I learned about how most body washes have a very high pH causing skin issues. I decided to test this out and it didn’t disappoint even though I already had high expectations  based on great reviews. I saw some reviews claimed it didn’t smell very good. I don’t think it’s repulsive or anything. I also didn’t exactly expect it to smell like Jo Malone. It’s a light, pleasant smell that pretty much goes away shortly after drying off.",2022-03-16 02:31:39.357232

While I actually find the scent pleasant, it gives me nausea and a migraine aura. Also, it doesn’t seem to wash well off my skin and causes breakouts. I would recommend this to those with dry skin and who aren’t sensitive to fragrances. I’m surprised something made for sensitive skin would have dyes and fragrance.",2022-03-16 02:31:39.357232
