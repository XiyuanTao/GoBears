I updated the device per the instructions and that was easy as well.,2022-03-16 06:12:48.848114
B09DCP1D61,2022,3,16,2,Kills your phone battery.,2.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2022",James Robb III,,Verified Purchase,,"I must admit that this thing works. It works well. But it uses wifi to communicate with your phone even though bluetooth is enabled as well. As a result your phone batter drains very rapidly. I spoke with a service rep and was just told I could plug my phone into another usb port to keep it charging. That, however defeated the purpose of getting the device in the first place- I didn't want to have to plug my phone in every time I got in my car. I decided to return it and just go back to plugging my phone in for Carplay. I really wanted it to work.",2022-03-16 06:12:48.848114
