B09LLLF8PG,2022,3,16,2,Really good camera quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,12 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2022",S. P.,,Verified Purchase,,"I have 3 cars, and this is now my 9th dash cam. I started with a battery based cam in each car. And they did not make it through the summer, so my next 6 have been capacitor based. And all of them have lasted until I upgraded. This is my 3rd front/rear cam. And it is the best one. The camera quality is really good. The video I posted is from about 5 feet away, and you can clearly read the text, that is tiny. I didn't want to post someone's license plate, but I can tell you that license plates are clear from a longer distance compared to any of the other cams I've had. It even includes a pry tool that makes running the long cable a lot easier. The menu is fast too. I can't find anything wrong with it after a week. I will update the review if that changes, but this one feels like a solid cam.",2022-03-16 05:50:15.697302
B09LLLF8PG,2022,3,16,3,Excellent upgrade and value,5.0 out of 5 stars,9 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2022",StrikeR,,Verified Purchase,,Let me start by saying I have an older version Vantrue dashcam which was 1080. At that time I had tried a few cheaper cams and returned them as the quality was not there and I suspected long term reliability. I decided you get what you pay and paid more to get the Vantrue. It has not disappointed me in the last 3 years and has been very reliable. I was interested in getting a cam to cover both front and back of the car after a few shady incidents on the road. I looked at what was currently available and wanted a 4k front sensor and didnâ€™t put a priority on the rear sensor. Looked at options available and decided to go with this one with a promising new sensor.,2022-03-16 05:50:15.697302
