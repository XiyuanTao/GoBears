I mean you can barely smell this inside the bottle & it only gets weaker outside the bottle. Make this one stronger Molton Brown or charge way less.,2022-03-16 03:49:28.557176

This particular smell is intoxicating!!!! No need for cologne after.  Smell isn’t too strong but strong enough to linger for a while and is amazing.  A little pricey but you only need a little bit so it will last for a long time.,2022-03-16 03:49:28.557176

But my main issue is im looking for something that has a lasting smell. I had a previous body wash that I would get compliments on all the time usually asking ""what cologne are you wearing it smells great."" and i'd tell them I don't wear cologne its my body wash. Unfortunately it was discontinued and i'm hunting for a new brand.",2022-03-16 03:49:28.557176
