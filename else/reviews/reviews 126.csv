The scents are clean and manly. The suddsing is very g ood, the rinse is clean as well. On a personal note, I use this soap for shaving.  My blade glides over my heavy beard and it rinsed  cleanly leaving me refreshed.  The soap has a long life and leaves little residue in the shower.",2022-03-16 03:45:15.771411
B01N49QENL,2022,3,16,2,Great scent and like the shape.,4.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2021",Alex Soper,,Verified Purchase,,"The shape of the soap is comfortable.  Something I've never thought about before, but once you've seen that they've put thought into the shape of the bar, it's nice.  The scent is just what a guy wants.  Fresh scent and my wife enjoys it.  The only thing is that it doesn't ""lather"" very well.  I've used other brands that lather well and make it easier for readability on the entire body.  In other words, if you want to wash your feet, you have to scrub the soap directly on your feet (instead of lathering in your hand or a wash cloth to then wash your feet).  Overall, the price is on point and the scent is good.",2022-03-16 03:45:15.771411

B000T9JM8S,2022,3,16,1,Non Drying Effective Cleanser,3.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2022",Rochelle Winston Davies,,Verified Purchase,,"My husband was in a rehabilitation facility after surgery.  This product was used by the facility and I liked it and was hoping to find it in stores.  Much to my disappointment, I was unable to find it anywhere save for Amazon.  This is an effective, non drying cleanser.  My only disappointment??  Twice I have ordered this product and twice it has come with the cap broken, which in turn causes it to arrive with a globby mess inside the plastic packaging they ship it in.  It also results in your losing a not-so-insignificant amount of product.  Wish they would package it better for shipment, hence the rating of only 3 stars.",2022-03-16 03:45:26.853093
