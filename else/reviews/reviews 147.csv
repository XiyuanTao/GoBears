Has great moisturizing ingredients for lips and feels so creamy. I purchased two shades in this line from L'Oreal and love both of them. I love this shade, Flaming Charmin, but Shade 202 Blooming Rose is so beautiful and goes with everything. I use a moisture balm on my lips to try to curb dry lips so I was surprised how fast the moisturizing in this lipstick goes away. Sometimes I use a lip primer and that helps keep moisture in. Those younger than I may not have this problem. I purchase many different lipsticks and glosses as I just love trying new colors and textures in lipstick and glosses. I do recommend this line from L'oreal.",2022-03-16 04:17:30.476129

It is not - it's orange!  The lipstick itself is nice - it was deeply pigmented and felt moisturizing, but on me this color is totally orange.

I am SO disappointed in this lipstick!  I love the shade!  It didn't feather like other lipsticks can do.  It did make my lips soft for a few hours (3), but NOT for 9 hours!  The flavor was nice and nothing strong like harsh chemicals and/or perfumes like some lipsticks have!  I wouldn't recommend this lipstick due to not lasting for color AND moisturizing!",2022-03-16 04:17:30.476129
