It's bad for the environment, dries out your skin, and is time consuming. But, after my wife left me, I realized I needed to change things...like my underwear and my hygiene. I decided to take the plunge and splurge on a couple of bottles of Pantene, and oh boy, I couldn't have been happier. I look like a new man! My wife even tried to come back, but I told her to get lost. My children were so surprised and elated, even they wanted to spend time with me, but I said no thanks hombres. I'm a new man, a better man...and so, I needed a better family! If you're like me, you'll appreciate everything this shampoo can do for you.",2022-03-16 01:20:40.293458

The product itself is creamy with a visible shine. This shampoo lathers well with a quarter size amount of product.
