Well when I went to use this product a week ago, it did not have Paul Mitchell shampoo in the bottle. Do not know what it is but it has left sores on my scalp. Buyer beware, you may not get what you paid for.",2022-03-16 01:29:10.074445

But for the price, it was disappointing to only get a little bit more than half of the bottle upon arrival. A bag was wrapped around the bottle but it still had opened and leaked everywhere. I wasn't home when it was delivered so I paid 24 bucks for half a bottle!",2022-03-16 01:29:10.074445

Normally you only require a small amount and it laters up very well. This seller must have watered it down as the consistency was different and I needed a minimum of 10 pumps to get a little bit of a lather. This shampoo is great but I would not purchase from this seller.,2022-03-16 01:29:10.074445

But she says that is the only shampoo that allows running her fingers through the hair while washing even before the conditioner is used. She combines it with a conditioner from the same line. The hair is shiny, silky, and healthy, even the damaged locks shine. It cleans well without drying out the hair, works well for oily hair and scalp.",2022-03-16 01:29:10.074445

B07FTLYSZM,2022,3,16,1,It works!,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2019",kelly,,Verified Purchase,,This shampoo is excellent at keeping my highlights from turning orange and my natural hair color is a very warm dark brown.  It’s only goal is to turn orange.  Since I went grey around my face/hairline I’m trying to blend ash blonde highlights with my grey in order to soften the contrast between my dark hair and the grey.  I need my highlights to stay as light as possible and if it weren’t for this shampoo I couldn’t pull it off.  I’ve always had to go to the salon every 6 to 8 weeks until I found this shampoo.  Now I can keep my highlights light for 3 months easy.  I’ve tried about 5 other brands and this is the first one that is so dark purple it’s almost black.  I did the math and this shampoo saves me about $500 a year in salon visits and I go through about 4 10oz. bottles per year.,2022-03-16 01:29:16.262926
B07FTLYSZM,2022,3,16,2,I found this just to be OK for what I wanted it for,3.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020",Traveler,,Verified Purchase,,"I have blonde hair with a little bit of low lights. I'd say my blonde is about a level 9. I got this based off of the reviews and really didn't see much of anything. I tried it twice and thought it would do well in between toning visits which are about every 2.5 to 3 months. It wasn't drying is all I can say. I've used other color based shampoos that work better to stay bright, but were way to drying as I have hair to my waist.....so? Maybe this would be great for periodic use on gray/white hair that wants to stay bright is my guess?",2022-03-16 01:29:16.262926

I had previously used another product for this from Keene but I couldn’t find it. I thought this would be the same, that maybe the name had been changed. Instead I ended up with purple splotches in my hair. I was only using it about once a week. Luckily, my stylist was able to cut most of it out. If I decide to try it again, I’ll try rinsing it out right away.",2022-03-16 01:29:16.262926
