B071NXJVK2,2022,3,16,2,Works Great to Stop Poison Ivy and Poison Sumac after contact.,5.0 out of 5 stars,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2020",Kevin B.,,Verified Purchase,,I used this product while I was clearing a section of my property that had substantial poison ivy and poison sumac.  Because this product removes oils it stops the start and spreading of these plants. I used it directly after being exposed and daily for a few days and never had more than a couple of little spots. It also helps stop the itching. This product works as good or better than Zanfel which cost $40.00 for 2 ounces.,2022-03-16 03:20:51.315406
B071NXJVK2,2022,3,16,3,"Works very well for me, a car/motorcycle hobbyist.",5.0 out of 5 stars,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2019",W. Ball,,Verified Purchase,,"This stuff sure works for me.  I am an old car and motorcycle enthusiast.  I do ALL my own maintenance and repairs ---big repairs sometimes.  I've used Orange cleaner with pumice.  It's been good, BUT I found this is MUCH more effective.  I was skeptical of ""dirt infused"", but no longer.  The hardest grime to clean off hands is the grime that becomes embedded after repeated hand washings.  You know...you get grimy,, clean, get grimy again, clean, repeat.  Each time the grime becomes more firmly part of your skin.  I should wear gloves more often but I just like the feel for the work when I use my bare hands.  I pay for it when it comes time to clean my hands.  THIS STUFF WORKS REGARDLESS.  I was surprised.  Anyway, you can see I'm sold on it.  Rather expensive, but you get what you pay for in this case.  I've had no problem with it being too thick to pump or clogging my sink, as a few reviews have indicated.  I will note that if you do not rinse it off very well, it leaves some kind of residue.  It feels a bit like hand lotion left on your hands, which sounds like a good thing, but I found it a bit too potent smelling if, say, you are going to work on food preparation.  So, rinse well!",2022-03-16 03:20:51.315406
B071NXJVK2,2022,3,16,4,Not nearly as good as the reviews by others.,1.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2021",nunyabusiness,,Verified Purchase,,"For starters I am a professional auto technician, as such I wash my hands in excess of 20X a day. My shop has always used Gojo ""Original Pumice"" which we were happy with. My nephew saw a video about this hand cleaner and asked if we would buy for the shop for the guys to try. This hand cleaner takes a significant amount of water to use, and, has left all four guys with dry cracked hands. In addition it takes significantly longer to wash our hands and the cleaning action pales in comparison to the Gojo we are accustomed to using, It is also significantly more expensive than the Gojo product. This product will not be bought again. I wonder why/how others have rated this product so highly. Do they work on greasy cars for a living? Or, have they ever used a hand cleaner that actually cleans their hands well? Something about these reviews with 5 starts is not right...",2022-03-16 03:20:51.315406
B071NXJVK2,2022,3,16,5,Hands down the best  hand cleaner for commercial grime!,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2019",Refelxblu,,Verified Purchase,,"I work in a print department of a factory where gojo is good enough for the rest of the company but doesn't quite cut it for printers. Working with ink for lithograph presses leaves ink embedded in your skin that's nearly impossible to get out. My co-workers and I searched for something better and we couldn't be happier with this product! At first you think how can this possibly work and then once it lathers up you can see the ink dissipate and with the use of an exfoliant sponge, it's like it never happened!  So now we take turns providing it for our selves because we can't live without it. It doesn't immediately dry out your hands like gojo does and it has a pleasant scent. In fact I like it so much, I bought a small tube of it for at home for when I miss a spot or two at work.",2022-03-16 03:20:51.315406

It’s so thick that you have to push very hard on the hand pump and before you use half the product the pump breaks . After using a large amount and rubbing my hands together for a longer than normal period of time I rinse only to find grease and oil stains that most other brands would easily remove. This is possibly the worst hand cleaner I have ever used.,2022-03-16 03:20:51.315406

I clean cars for a living so my hands are filthy at the end of the day and i cant get them clean with regular soap. I bought a hand scrub brush to go with it and it works wonders. Leaves my hands clean and soft in the end. Definitely worth it! Theres a huge amount, so it should last a while. Only problem is that the tube can clog if left for a while (it says on the container), so keep that in mind! Other than that, its amazing",2022-03-16 03:20:51.315406
