I Merlot on and it lasted through eating and drinking.. Slight amount of transfer while it’s still drying.. which takes a while and it’s sticky until it’s done drying.. I’d say like 15-20 minutes.. After it’s dry very very little transfer.. The pictures showed are the color directly after drying and then 24 hrs later.. I slept with it on and then it was rubbed against my jeans all day at work.. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the actual color pallet.. I’m disappointed in the two darkest shades.. The ads show them being nice deep purple colors but in reality the whole set it just varying shades of pinks and reds.. Pretty.. But I was really looking forward to those deep purple tones..,2022-03-16 05:24:43.956934

        VINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,"This is one of the few real lipstains on Amazon, it stains (and stays on) like permanent marker.  It comes with applicators, but applies and dries like permanent marker without the sticky feeling on your lips. The colors are dark and bright if you apply them like the description says.  I prefer a more natural/subtle look, so I only put one layer on the inside of the lips (as suggested), then smear it with my finger to cover the rest of the lips, and use a makeup remover to clean up the lines. I put on lip balm on top to keep my lips from drying.  This stays on all day until I remove it.  Even after eating greasy food, it barely fades. I just re-apply lip balm, and not have to worry about looking in the mirror.  The first picture is without any lipstick, the others are with the lightest application of 4 colors.  I probably won't use the 2 darkest ones.  I wish they made them in natural shades, too.",2022-03-16 05:24:43.956934

        TOP 500 REVIEWER",Verified Purchase,,"This is a great price point for 6 lip different shades of lip tint. They come in the cutest bottles I’ve ever seen, little wine bottles. I did need to put on many layers in to get the look of the colors in the pictures. But you get long lasting color, that doesn’t smudge easy I don’t get those gross lip stains on glasses and easy to remember. If anything Issue,I would say it'd be nice to use less coats but the color looks amazing monday the less",2022-03-16 05:24:43.956934
