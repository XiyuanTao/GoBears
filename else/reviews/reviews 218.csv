I bought this kit so I could repair a broken lipstick and try making lip scrubs.  The picture is of a lipscrub I made for the first time (with brown sugar which is the weird brown stain).  The recipe was soft, so I had some trouble getting it out of the mold (I even broke the lipstick) but used the included syringe and was able to place it in the tube and roll it up and down.  This kit included two lipstick tubes that work really well.  Next time I will experiment with the recipe to make the lipstick harder and maybe use a q tip to oil the silicone mold for an easier release, but I really like this kit and had fun.  I am also looking forward to the next time I have a broken lipstick because I can fix it.",2022-03-16 05:33:58.458478
