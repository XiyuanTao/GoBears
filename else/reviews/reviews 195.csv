I have issues with allergic reactions to almost every lip product on the market, including most organic, all-natural, vegan, and/or popular brands and types.  I used to wear lip products with beeswax, but one day my lips began to itch and swelled to three times their normal size, and ever since then I have not been able to wear lip gloss or lipstick, only petroleum jelly.  That was a big (and sad!!) change for me, as I used to wear colored lip products all the time.  I am SO happy to finally have found a nice, softening, conditioning lipstick in a gorgeous color that my lips can handle! I will certainly buy more colors soon! :)",2022-03-16 05:15:19.906279

You donâ€™t have to wear a lip balm. I am a fair skinned Asian and this color seems to be universal so it would suit everyone. Love this lippie on me. Definitely buy the Creamy Rose! There is no filter on the pic (to show the exact color). I always get compliments with this lipstick. Stop what youâ€™re doing and just buy Creamy Rose!",2022-03-16 05:15:19.906279

This lipstick is gorgeous. Feels so smooth and soft as I'm putting it on, and lips are well moisturized, shiny and happy, at first. I thought that finally I found what I was looking for all these years! Unfortunately I have to be allergic to some ingredient in it, because that great feeling doesn't last, and my lips after a few minutes start to feel very dry andÂ weird. I do have a lot of sensitivity to different products so I believe that must be it. I had this lipstick for over 2 months and each time I try to apply the same thing happens. For other people I would definitely recommend it.",2022-03-16 05:15:19.906279

The application is so smooth, similar to a lipgloss but without the sticky or tacky feeling. I only have to reapply maybe after eating (pretty normal) but the product tends to stay on well. I'm in love with the color, it isn't too light but also not extremely pink. I would recommend this product if you're looking for something that feels light and moisturizing.",2022-03-16 05:15:19.906279

It was so hot that the lipstick was melted.  I put it in the freezer after trying to put it back together.  I should have taken a picture but did not think of it.  I did put some on and the whole stick was wiggling so it is still broken further down.,2022-03-16 05:15:19.906279
