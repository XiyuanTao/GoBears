Mathewson,,Verified Purchase,,"I have literally tried everything to clear up my acne and nothing has seemed to help. After using Dr. Bronner's Tea Tree (morning & night) along with Thayers Rose Petal Toner & Christina Moss Organic Moisturizer, my face has never been clearer. Within 5 days I noticed less rash-like bumps on my face and old marks seem to be fading. I had the problem as well of breaking out after 1 day of wearing makeup. But yesterday was the first day that didn't happen wearing my Lanc√¥me foundation. I truly believe I was over washing with Benzoyl Peroxide products & treatments. I have very sensitive & oily skin so finding Dr. Bronner's was a lifesaver. Makes my face much less oily without stripping it completely. Absolutely recommend! Not to mention, you can use it for practically any household cleaning. Great for the price!",2022-03-16 03:33:41.161992

I was getting my house ready to sell & wanted a natural cleanser for many different surfaces. This cleaned the bathroom tiles & porcelain like crazy!! So shiny, everything looked brand new. You need a little elbow grease to wipe it off - I recommend a microfiber towel. You'll get unbelievable shine!! Same for the kitchen. Just don't use it on stainless appliances. My realtor asked if I had a professional cleaner. Well sort of - nothing like castile soap. A small amount with water goes a very long way. Totally Recommend!",2022-03-16 03:33:41.161992

Stern,,Verified Purchase,,"It's like if a 1982 Volvo station wagon covered in stickers wished to become a bottle of soap. That said, these maniacs make good bar soap. The liquid soap seems about as good -- it seems to have has a nice non-synthetic tea tree smell, too! Hopefully, by rubbing this into my scalp, I'm not getting secretly turned into a cult member or an odd religious zealot because you never know what the alien life forms are working on in their laser lairs in Saskatoon, where the bodies of Abraham Lincoln and Bob Dylan (the real one, not the clone robot that replaced him in 1964) are stored for use in the upcoming celery wars we must not eat celery!

As a 4C natural, I could easily spend $500+ each year on various shampoos, conditioners, and body washes from Shea Moisture, Cantu, Taliah Wahid, and the other big names. It seems like the more ""natural"" a product is, the higher the price.",2022-03-16 03:33:41.161992

It's not as thick as I thought it would be, but it's very concentrated - doesn't take much to do the job. I love this stuff, I mostly use it in the shower - I wash my face with it when I'm having a breakout and it helps clear my face up, I wash my hair with it when I'm having bad dandruff and the flakes and itchiness go away, I wash my dog with it when her skin is irritated and it helps her too. Leaves a very clean feeling. I've used it as a bubble bath, but DONT PUT ALOT - the Tea Tree cooling/burning sensation was too much for my sensitive skin. It can also dry my face out if I'm using it too much, so I try not to wash my face with it every day. But overall highly recommended!",2022-03-16 03:33:41.161992
