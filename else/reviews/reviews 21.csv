I am trying to move towards more natural products.  My hair stylist recommended this b/c it is vegan/ organic.  Often curly hair people are told to use conditioner only.  I tried that with these products and was extremely disappointed.  I tried again using the shampoo & conditioner....and it was amazing!!  You must use these products together!  They work amazing together!!!  1/31/21 new review:  I still think Surface Curls is an amazing product with amazing curl results.  HOWEVER, I am gradually finding replacements.  I have naturally dirty blonde color hair.  I regularly get my hair highlighted.  I have found that this product makes my hair very yellow .. not the bright light blonde it was.  I have not had any response from Surface nor has my hair stylist.  While I love the curl results I do not like what it is doing to my color.  I would not recommend this product to another blonde.  Dark hair should be great.",2022-03-16 01:23:26.071752
B00IYWKF0G,2022,3,16,2,Best shampoo for my curly course hair,5.0 out of 5 stars,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2019",Lantana,,Verified Purchase,,"I have curly course hair that I blow dry straight and flat iron, so it needs all the moisturizing in the world but also something that will clean my scalp well between shampoos as I can go a while between shampoos. This one does the trick. I’ve used it the past several years and although my stylist has given me samples of other products, I just won’t give up this shampoo or the conditioner. My sister has completely different hair from me, not problem hair as I consider mine to be. Her hair is thick, wavy, and smoother than my hair but I turned her on to this shampoo and conditioner and she’s sold as well. My only complaint is the packaging from the shipper; the bottles are packed loose in a box and get thrown around during shipping. The product itself is glorious, highly recommend the conditioner as well.",2022-03-16 01:23:26.071752
B00IYWKF0G,2022,3,16,3,Fabulous product but unacceptable shipping,1.0 out of 5 stars,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2020",cindy berg,,Verified Purchase,,"I'll start by saying I've used Surface products for years, and the Surface Therapeutic Awaken Shampoo is amazing.  I'm in my early 50s and have had thinning hair since my early 40s.  I've used this product for about 2 years, and my hair is now as thick as it was in my 30s.  My reason for the one-star rating is the packaging.  I opened the plastic white envelope today after it arrived and noticed a considerable amount of shampoo inside the envelope.  I can hold the bottle up to the light and see approx. 25% of it leaked out of the lid during shipping.  There was no plastic/bubble packaging or tape over the lid.  The bottle was just loose inside the envelope.  The price of this item has gone from $59 to $67 in a month.  In my opinion, that's expensive for a 33 oz. bottle, but I'm willing to pay more because it's an excellent product.  However, if customers are paying such a high price, they should receive ALL of the product.  If a simple piece of tape had been put over the lid, I'd have been able to rate this product 5 stars...hands down!",2022-03-16 01:23:26.071752

Not worth it,1.0 out of 5 stars,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2017",Amazon Customer,,Verified Purchase,,"I’m glad that I used my Amazon gift card to purchase this product because it was s complete waste. I never use products that have sulfates, parabens, or silicones and this product contains both sulfates and silicones! On Surface Hairs website they claim to be sulfate and paraben free. Don’t believe it! I checked the ingredients right when I got this. So disappointed. I even emailed the company asking if they use sulfates, parabens, or silicones and they said no. This proves that you have to read the ingredients before you purchase a product.",2022-03-16 01:23:26.071752
