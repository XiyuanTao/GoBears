I shampoo, rinse, then add this and my hair is soft, silky, and smooth even without the use of conditioner. An smells great, too! It's watery, so i just use the tip to apply lines to my scalp and then massage it around. It sudses up a little bit, which is great because then I know where it's being distributed. I let it sit while i do the rest of my shower, rinse it out, and I'm good to go! Will buy again!",2022-03-16 01:53:04.622379
