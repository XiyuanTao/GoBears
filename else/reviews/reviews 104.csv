B09RJRGMMH,2022,3,16,1,Watery,2.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2020",Tanya F,,Verified Purchase,,"I have bought Bath and Body Works Foaming Hand Soaps for years, and loved it as it lasts for a while.  Due to covid I opted to purchase the hand soap online, and came across this set which seemed like a reasonable deal.  When I received it I did not noticed any deference until we started to use it.  Normally one container lasts us approximately a month (give or take).  We just started to use one last week, and it is already half way through.  The foam is not as frothy as I am used to and at times it will just squirt out pure liquid.  At first I thought it was just one container that had a faulty pump, but this is happening to every single one of the soaps in this set.  If you are like me, and truly love this product, I would not recommend you getting this particular set. Or purchase it from this vendor.  Buy it directly from Bath and Body Works.",2022-03-16 03:22:58.488767
