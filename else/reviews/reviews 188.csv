B01GEWSZ8G,2022,3,16,2,Five Stars - Bloom (and Heirloom),5.0 out of 5 stars,11 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2016",Lala Red,,Verified Purchase,,"Bloom- Creamy, non-drying, rich color, long lasting too.  So far I have been really happy with Glominerals lip colors.  I would describe Bloom as a medium pink color with red tones.  It's not a neutral pink like Willow or Bella, which I find closer to skin tone than a true pink.  Bloom is deeper in color than Heirloom, which is more of a dusty rose color.  It's hard to determine color based on the illustrations provided so hopefully my description will help some.",2022-03-16 05:10:23.770202

In fact, I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get more out of the stick than what shows on the tip initially.  Going to call Glo Skin tomorrow.
