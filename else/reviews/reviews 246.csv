B08XZPDZC7,2022,3,16,1,Buy from Nexar not from Amazom.,5.0 out of 5 stars,439 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2021",Randy,,Verified Purchase,,Do not buy this dash cam from Amazon. I repeat do not buy this or any Nexar cam from Amazon. The reason why is because if the cam stops working after the Amazon return window has closed you will be stuck with a cam that does not work. If you try to use the one year warranty through Nexar they will refer you to Amazon because you purchased the cam through Amazon.  You will also not be able to get the warranty through Nexar because you won't have a nexar order number because you didn't buy from Nexar but purchased through Amazon.  Buy from Amazon at your own risk.,2022-03-16 05:54:29.962993

For a camera that requires you to evey time to record tour routes by GPS for it to even work without giving you the option of just recording is just terrible for me. GPS tracking is a great function for extra information, and also can be vital for emergency situations. But it can also represent a privacy uneasiness for  some people. I would like to have the option to not record GPS information, unless a hard-brake event or an accident is detected..",2022-03-16 05:54:29.962993
B08XZPDZC7,2022,3,16,3,Video from internal camera not saved unless you manually do it during the ride. Yuck.,2.0 out of 5 stars,112 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2019",Oxoned,,Verified Purchase,,"I'm using this for rideshare, and the internal camera is just a huge pain. In order to obtain video from the internal camera you need to create a clip MANUALLY WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING IN 20-SECOND INCREMENTS while the customer is sitting there. After the ride ends, any non-clipped internal video is immediately dumped and you can't retrieve it. The external video, in comparison, automatically saves to your phone and uploads to the cloud.",2022-03-16 05:54:29.962993

Also if you want to review video playback on the app you need to have you're location services turned on the whole time during every drive. I drive a lot so with my location services being constantly on along with charging my phone the phone heats up like crazy. so get ready to have a hot phone every time you want to drive somewhere. garbage product and would not recommend to anyone.,2022-03-16 05:54:29.962993
