B00008KA8D,2022,3,16,1,Lasts All Day!,5.0 out of 5 stars,6 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2019",Tina Marquesen,,Verified Purchase,,"I love how this lipstain will last all day long, even through meals! Although it is drying to your lips, there is a great moisturizer included on the other side of the container. But as with most moisturizers, they only last so long. So if you don't mind reapplying the moisturizer, it works beautifully. No real need to reapply the color unless you happen to want to brighten it up after several hours. And really when you think about it, you would have to freshen up regular lipstick often, so at least with this you don't lose the color.",2022-03-16 04:13:56.633777
B00008KA8D,2022,3,16,2,then it comes off easily. This is how all lip color should be ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,10 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2017",Amazon Customer,,Verified Purchase,,"I use this almost every day. I only have to put it on once and it lasts all day. I have eaten, kissed, and even brushed my teeth while wearing this; it just doesn't come off no matter what I'm doing until I use makeup remover, then it comes off easily. This is how all lip color should be in my opinion. I love not having to worry about checking or reapplying my lip color throughout the day. It also doesn't leave that ""lip gloss"" feel that is uncomfortable to my boyfriend while kissing sometimes. I have forgotten I was wearing it before, but it still looks perfect.The color is great and seems to go with everything. It has made looking good so much easier. I love it.",2022-03-16 04:13:56.633777

B00008KA8D,2022,3,16,4,Great Product - Wasteful Packaging,3.0 out of 5 stars,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2019",A. DELANGE,,Verified Purchase,,"I would have given this product an extra star based on its own merits. I love the product, but the color side does tend to run out quickly because there isn't that much of it to begin with, as it shares space with the clear sealer. The color is beautiful and it does last. However the packaging is extremely wasteful. This product could be delivered in a small bubble envelope, rather than a box that is gigantic in comparison to the size of the product. Inside, there is plastic insulation material that is also excessive. I appreciate the ease and convenience of ordering by mail, but feel bad about the unnecessary and excessive packaging and the lack of concern about wastefulness.",2022-03-16 04:13:56.633777

The lipstick is sticky. Gross sticky. It never stops being sticky. It flakes off in some spots & stains in others. It came unsealed. There is barely any product in the tube I bought & guess what? No returns. The clear top coat is like never drying glue. Worst lipstick ever. No way all these other women could like this stuff. We like our lips soft. I feel like I got had. Lesson learned.,2022-03-16 04:13:56.633777

If you eat a salad with any type of oil, the bottom lip will come off somewhat but the top lip stays on, just apply a little to bottom lip and you are done. Only gave 4 stars for moisturizing b/c I really don‚Äôt know if that is in it or not. What I can say, is I‚Äôve been wearing this lipstick for years in the sun, I have never gotten a sun burn or blister on my lips. I believe this lipstick protects your lips.",2022-03-16 04:13:56.633777

It didn‚Äôt stay on through a meal like my Covergirl lip stain that applies easier and stays on much longer. The colors are more true as well. The gloss with this is very tiny and doesn‚Äôt apply well either. I‚Äôd return but not really worth the effort.,2022-03-16 04:13:56.633777
