I’ve tried multiple over the counter lice treatments only to have them again within a months time. After having to treat everyone, the house & cars over and over. It gets very expensive. Having 2 girls & myself with long hair we would use 3 to 4 boxes at a time to treat the family. It would take hours. I was looking for something with good reviews on Amazon and came across this product & after reading the reviews I figured it was worth a shot. I ordered 2 bottles, one for each bathroom. We all washed our hair with this shampoo & followed with our regular conditioner everyday for a week without any other other  lice treatment to ourselves, home or car. After the week was over I checked everyone to see how well it worked & there weren’t any lice at all. It’s been about 3 or 4 months without any further treatment and we haven’t had another problem. I love the fact that i didn’t have to treat everything and it got rid of the lice with just washing our hair. I plan on keeping this shampoo on hand to use weekly during the school year as preventative maintenance.",2022-03-16 01:34:50.666665

I can't say for sure whether it works with regard to lice.  I haven't yet used it for preventive purposes.  However, when I found I had lice, I did some home remedies first, then combed out my hair thoroughly, and then used this shampoo once I received it a couple of days later.  I did get rid of the lice/nits within 7 days or so, but I did a lot of combing during that time.  Still, I have a hunch this shampoo contributed to me not getting the lice back since there were probably nits lying around on clothes and furniture (I had the itching for a few weeks before realizing what it was).  And having long hair, it's hard to do a really thorough combing job, so it's nice to have the shampoo as reinforcement in the lice eradication effort.",2022-03-16 01:34:50.666665

The second time, I left it on again for 10 minutes, and this time it completely removed it. The scent of the shampoo was nice, and not too overwhelming. The color of it was dark dark blue that turned lighter as you applied it.

I figured I would do it to help other people out because I’m a kind of person who always looks at 3748292847 million reviews when but something. So I have seen other people but this and it is damaged when it comes in the mail. I have not used it yet. I’m going to upload pictures a before and after to show you guys what one use looks like !! I have dark brown hair now ! Im trying to do a balayage. Right now my hair is in the stage where it is yellow with just a little brass so I figured why not get these two shampoos and maybe mix it together and let it set in my hair. These pictures are a before and after. The one of me taking a picture in the mirror is before and the side view is after. This is after one use only. Left of hair for 2 mins next time will leave on hair for 5 mins. On the bottle it says leave on for 1-5 mins! So I didn’t wanna leave it on too long because I never used it before. I used gloves but I don’t think it will stain your hands if you wash right away. Since they work together very well if you just get one or the other it will work for your hair if you have yellow hair or brassy hair. I was surprised how it took MOST of the yellow out !! With sitting in my hair only for two mins!! I will leave my name at the end of this so you can look at for when I do use it again. I’m reallt not sure how many times you can use this. I was told you are supposed to use this shampoo twice a week. My friend said she uses it every other day and her hair is white blonde !! It don’t smell too bad either. But if your like me and in the process of coloring your hair to help keep moisture in your hair I would use “ it’s a ten mask “ as conditioner. That stuff WORKS ! Love it. It’s expensive but I will pay for it. Helps with everything !!-lindsay,2022-03-16 01:37:17.217994

B01MU9VI4Q,2022,3,16,1,This shampoo does exactly what it’s designed to do!,5.0 out of 5 stars,457 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2018",Vic,,Verified Purchase,,"Blonde hair is a job to maintain if you naturally have a darker shade of hair. A lot of the reviews left on this product are from ladies with not enough education on how the blonde hair/purple shampoo fully work. The comments saying that it made their hair bluish/purplish and leaving negative feedback is because there’s no education behind how purple and blonde work together. The dryness of the hair after using this product is also uneducated...Who would think that by bleaching your hair and maintaining a color that’s not naturally your color is going to not dry your hair out? There’s a double edged sword here.  You want light blonde hair, here’s some things to remember when using a purple shampoo...1- the opposite of blonde is purple, so the shampoo helps brighten your dingy blonde. It’s not unusual for your hair to have hints of purple the first time through. It WILL wash out the second or third time. 2- you’re using purple shampoo to lift some brassiness off of your hair. It’s not unusual for your hair to be slightly drier when you rinse the shampoo out. Your hair WILL go back to normal the second or third wash. 3- use the purple shampoo every 3 or 4 times you wash your hair. Don’t lean on this as your daily shampoo. The more frequently you use it, the drier your hair will become. The product does exactly what it’s supposed to do if you use it correctly. I applied the shampoo on dry hair and left it on for abou 10 minutes, then washed it out and followed with conditioner. This helps brighten the hair (as well as give it the purple pigment, as it should) without diluting the shampoo with water. I was going for a brighter look. Using it to shampoo your hair in the shower for a minute will do the trick, too, but keep in mind that the shampoo gets diluted when water is added to it, causing it to not lift as much beassiness as you may want. The product does exactly what it’s designed to do, so if you feel the need to complain about the product making your hair blue/purple or drying your hair out, maybe blonde isn’t a a color option that you should continue to maintain. There’s a price to pay for beauty, so do your research!",2022-03-16 01:40:37.553610

The first time I used it I left it on for 1 minute, now I'm leaving it on for 3 minutes. Better safe than sorry. Play around with the timing but be cautious and go longer the next time if you're not happy with the result. Your hands turn purple, but wash them right after you apply the shampoo and it will wash off (duh).  Have a cleaning rag in the shower to wipe down all of the purple splatters, it might be hard to remove if you let it dry, so just take care of it right away. It is pretty drying, so use conditioner after you wash the shampoo out. I have been using it once a week, and that's working for me.",2022-03-16 01:40:37.553610

My beard looks fantastic, smells great, is soft to the touch, and it protects my beard hair follicles. Additionally, because the shampoo leaves my skin soft and moisturized, I wind up needing to use less beard oil. So the color lasts even longer than I expected, allowing me to go around 2 weeks between touch-ups. Of course, it works great on my scalp hair as well, so it's a one-stop-shop, and a double win for me. In all honesty, it's been my Pure Argan was everything I hope and more.

B09PJ5B543,2022,3,16,4,My daughter had Never-ending dry scalp,5.0 out of 5 stars,232 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2019",Valerie,,Verified Purchase,,My daughter had a section of her scalp that was so dry every time I brushed it I actually thought I was seeing lice nits. Upon closer inspection I realized they weren’t nits but dead skin flakes. I tried everything even Head & Shoulders clinical to no avail the damn flakes wouldn’t go away. I went against the directions on this bottle though. Tea tree oil does not smell good and I wasn’t about to let oil sit on my child head all day. 30 minutes before a shower I would literally baste that part of her head in this oil and then she would shampoo and rinse it out. After 2-3 consistent uses it went away and never came back and her hair is flake free now! I know she is prone to dry scalp so to maintain moisture I plan to use this on her only once a week...it really works!,2022-03-16 01:44:20.228207

Use it as designed put conditioner on a wet hair first than shampoo so it don't fall heavy and protects your hair it's lambo of shampoos. So amazing smell is ok present but nothing to good smells nice tho but it's great for a hair as this isn't a treatment it gives immediate results but I'm sure through time it might make hair stronger and more elastic not sure as it does its job first time . I also have done very long hair black treated not dyed and fine so it's very glossy to I like it .Recommended,2022-03-16 01:47:24.904418
