Know,,Verified Purchase,,"I've worn lipsticks, balms, and stains since 1972.  And, I'm a retired cosmetologist/aesthetician.  I have a couple of long-wearing products that have been in my arsenal for the last five years.  After reading all the hoopla about this item, I decided to try it.  However, I cannot remember ever opening a box and finding a new cosmetic item 'NWOB' that wasn't clear in the description.  I avoid them...AND, I cannot recall a tube ever having a CAUTION: FLAMMABLE warning next to the color name and code!!  WTH??!!",2022-03-16 05:11:48.077862

It removes easily with any oil or make up remover, or even a firm hand with a baby wipe. Love their color selection too.",2022-03-16 05:11:48.077862
