B01G4WNGGM,2022,3,16,1,Gentle on eczema and smells incredible,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2019",Nicole Mims ,,Verified Purchase,,"I just used this on my son today. He has eczema and aquaphor bodywash had been irritating his skin so I read a million reviews of baby bodywash and decided on this. It has a strong sweet, baby powder smell right out of the bottle. It lathers nicely and left his skin feeling smooth as if I'd applied lotion! There was no redness or irritation after bath time at all. The best part is how it left this soft, sweet, non-babypowder smell. I despise the smell of baby powder so I was really disappointed until that scent vanished and was replaced by this amazing, indescribable, fresh, sweet scent. Wow.",2022-03-16 03:24:31.953105

I liked that it was thin and not very foamy, but it completely washed off all my baby's natural oils. Her skin felt squeaky clean and was soon very dry. The smell was not very desirable either, it was very medicinal.",2022-03-16 03:24:31.953105
B01G4WNGGM,2022,3,16,4,Unsealed,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020",S.Reader,,Verified Purchase,,"This arrived unsealed. It has been a long time since I have needed baby products much less sensitive skin ones, so I cannot remember if Mustela was unsealed at VonMaur or not, but I was genuinely shocked it wasn't sealed... It is something that is pricey and for babies, I am surprised there wasn't a temper evident seal. It was delivered in a baggy in a bubble mailer so leaking was minimal. I am still not sure how I feel...",2022-03-16 03:24:31.953105
B01G4WNGGM,2022,3,16,5,Ok product,3.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2019",Paige,,Verified Purchase,,I love the smell of the product but it did dry out my baby's skin and made it flaky almost like she had cradle cap so I had to stop using it.  I only bought the small bottle to try and thank god I did.  I changed cleansers and the flaky dry skin didn't happen with the other cleanser I used.  I so wanted to like this product tho bc it seemed like a very reputable company that produces it.,2022-03-16 03:24:31.953105

I have sensitive skin and a lot of the facial washes I have tried just seem to make my face feel dry. Not with this. I still do use a moisturizer after it though. I love the smell too. Same smell as other Mustela products that my son uses.,2022-03-16 03:24:31.953105

Have been using this for over 8 years with each of our babies. Was so happy to find these travel size bottles - easy to take with us on the go. Great product, baby smells so good. Initially started to use this when a friend recommended it for our oldest child‚Äôs eczema as a baby. Cleared up immediately. Haven‚Äôt considered using any other product since then.",2022-03-16 03:24:31.953105
