I was expecting a nude color when it said natural but it is pink in color, but when I put it on my lips itâ€™s matches perfectly  I love it because  It makes my lips pop, very natural looking, itâ€™s not sticky, and itâ€™s moistures my lips .. I will definitely buy more",2022-03-16 04:22:53.488660

Pretty color.,5.0 out of 5 stars,80 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019",TianaPix,,Verified Purchase,,"Iâ€™m surprised I like it so much. I was not expecting it to not be sticky, which is what stops me from buying glosses. This one is amazing. Not sticky, fine glitter and subtle color so my lips look natural in pigment. I recommend this Snow Pink color and more. Iâ€™ll probably buy more colors.",2022-03-16 04:22:53.488660

It glides on smoothly and easily. The color is bold and makes my lips pop with intense shine. Itâ€™s very moisturizing and lasts for quite a while. Too bad I canâ€™t show off my sexy lips quite yet because they are always masked, for now. But itâ€™s ok. I wear it at home and my husband is loving it on me for so many reasons!  Buy it! You canâ€™t go wrong with affordable beauty products.",2022-03-16 04:22:53.488660

It really took me by surprise because I remember Revlon glosses being super gloopy and stick. This one isnâ€™t nothing like that. Itâ€™s the kind of gloss that almost feels like a balm.,2022-03-16 04:22:53.488660

I recently got into lip gloss and I fell in love with Rihanna's Bomb Gloss but I'm trying to save my money. I found that the swatch is really similar and I wish I had a photo to compare the two but I really enjoy Revlon's Rosy Future. It is a bit sheer but on my lips it really does compliment my natural lip color, so it's like my lips but better. You do have to reapply more if you want the color to be more opaque, but I really don't mind having to do that since this gloss is only 6 dollars lol what could you expect. Overall I would definitely buy it again!",2022-03-16 04:22:53.488660

B08QYKPRFV,2022,3,16,7,Blissed out and fatal apple - gorgeous and perfect for everyday!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,16 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020",Nemisa,,Verified Purchase,,"These are just so so perfect! They feel exactly like a liquid lip balm. Not at all overly glossy, reflective, or glass-like, which is why I strayed away from glosses many times. These are just great!!! I love them! They can definitely be used in a professional setting. Don't be afraid about any opaque pigment issues with these shades. They go on very sheer and balmy with a sort of clear, gel-like base. Fatal apple is exactly like a clear red that reads as a sheer, clear red-pink (DUPE FOR GLOSSIER 'RED'). Blissed out is a perfect sheer warm, clear-pink with gorgeous shimmers that is not at all over the top (DUPE FOR FENTY 'FU$$Y'), and it will definitely work on many skin tones because it doesn't have any opaque color. It is like a clear pink gel with tiny shimmers. You can only see the shimmers if you examine your lips up close with a mirror. Otherwise from even a short distance, it just looks like you're wearing a slightly reflective lip balm. So so so good. I 100% plan on repurchasing after I finish. These are my new faves!!!",2022-03-16 04:22:53.488660

Much cheaper and I really like it. Looks great when applied over a lip pencil. Just enough color and shine, which is what I wanted. Easy to apply, not sticky, lips are moist. Also bought one for a friend. Got this just before the price went up but would still purchase again.",2022-03-16 04:22:53.488660
