Really don't understand where this item gets such a high rating, but as we have come to expect on Amazon the manufacturers are manipulating the ratings with giveaways, etc. The cords are absolutely not long enough on all fronts. The power cable is not long enough to reach from the front seat cigarette lighter. The connection cables for each monitor are also not long enough to reach from seat to seat in your average minivan. This is my biggest pet peeve with the manufacturers of these is they need to include at least another three feet of cable on all of the connecting cables. The plastic mounting brackets are also worthless on your average minivan as the screws aren't long enough to screw into the headrest posts. They do have straps so we tried those, they just slip right off the headrest into a position that isn't viewable for the average child. Part of the reason we bought these is because of the plastic mounts and not the fabric straps as we've been down that road before. The screens are nice, that is one positive we can say about them. Unless you're using these in an economy or compact car we cannot recommend them whatsoever.",2022-03-16 05:51:44.328571

Worked well out of package, but when they needed charged, they would not charge. Tried cords in package, and other replacement cords. Units would not charge, so I returned it. Nice units otherwise.

We unboxed the screens and it only took about 3 minutes to get them all hooked up, synced and a movie playing. Installing them in the car was super simple as well. Only took a few minutes.
