        VINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,"I received 4 bottles just like the listing states. I was a bit worried because of all the reviews stating they only received 1 bottle. I received a manufacturer sealed box of 4 bottles, no issues there. In regards to the scent, wow. It smells SO good. Not super sweet or cologne like. It’s hard to describe but my wife loves it and that’s what matters most! It’s also very moisturizing. Perfect.",2022-03-16 03:43:27.298500

As a black man, it's hard to find products that help our skin consistently. We've known for years that Cocoa Butter/Shea Butter is the best thing that works for us, but we had to buy multiple products & mix them to create what we needed for skin nourishment. My Granddad and my Dad are all Old Spice fanatics and I too follow them. I've used this product for a few months and I have found a permanent solution, the only way to make it better it to make it bigger. AWESOME!",2022-03-16 03:43:27.298500

About a week into using it, he said that he didn’t care for the smell but it wasn’t terrible. A few days later he seemed to have eczema spots on his torso, which he hadn’t had in several years. He started treating it with a cream that works for him & it responded. About a week or so later he complained that his skin felt funny. The eczema is almost gone, but everything else is extremely dry. The only change has been this soap. He won’t be using it any longer & I will now be donating 3 unopened bottles.",2022-03-16 03:43:27.298500

I’m not sure why he didn’t care about how smelly he was or what goes through an adolescent boy’s mind to get them to hate showers. A friend of mine with a slightly older son recommended this and now the only problem I have is that he doesn’t want to share. The whole bathroom smells so good when he showers now and he’s even begun to willingly use old spice deodorant.,2022-03-16 03:43:27.298500

I am not disappointed. It has a unique and fresh scent that lasts a surprisingly long time, and as far as body wash goes, it keeps my skin relatively moisturized. I have dry skin though, so I usually still have to apply lotion after a shower. However, my skin is noticeably less dry after using this body wash. It is also cheaper in single and bulk purchases compared to my previous go to body washes.",2022-03-16 03:43:27.298500
