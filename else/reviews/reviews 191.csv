They last a very long time too. When it gets too dry just add a little lip gloss (I use carmex) to your lip. Very beautiful. The Wild Fire is a very saturated hot red. It's very seeeeeexyyyy. I've been using these colors for years.,2022-03-16 05:13:29.466136
B074NGG98L,2022,3,16,2,Worst lipstick I have ever used.,1.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2018",Jordan,,Verified Purchase,,"I was super excited about this color.  I put one coat on & it didn't cover at all, went to add a second coat & it just peeled the first layer off & looked way worse. Washed my lips & tired again with a lip primer. No dice. Looked just as bad. Left if on to see if it was at least durable. 20 minutes late & it looked like I was wearing only lip liner. This is as cheap as the price. I prefer my NYX, Atleast that stuff goes on nicely & stays put.",2022-03-16 05:13:29.466136

Did not apply evenly. Had to apply many layers and after all that effort, it came off very easily after one sip of a drink. I was very disappointed in this product because I was excited with all the colors. Unless it was the one I received, I would not recommend this.",2022-03-16 05:13:29.466136
B074NGG98L,2022,3,16,5,RubyKisses has a website that has other amazing lip brands but this particular product can't be purchased there.,5.0 out of 5 stars,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2018",Jocelyn,,Verified Purchase,,This is my favorite matte lipstick brand. I tried my first one which was that classic Instagram Mauve Pink. Id been searching for that color forever and it either was too bright for my complexion or was sold out from everywhere. I purchased the mauve from my local beauty supply store that actually had many of the brands colors. I didnt want to go back to the beautysupply so i found the brand online. I hate that you can't purchase them directly from their site though.but these are the best with amazing colors!!!,2022-03-16 05:13:29.466136
