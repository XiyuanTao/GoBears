There is no filter on the photo. It is that dark. I tried to apply it thinking maybe the color would be lighter once it goes on, but it was too thick and dry to even apply.

I ordered this almost 4 days before Christmas and it arrived to days later. The color itself is gorgeous. It's a little darker than the picture but I blame that on my screen resolution. I love that the color doesn't bleed and can be worn with or without liner. It stays put and doesn't come off easily throughout the day. Unless you're doing a whole lot of lip-smacking, you my need to reapply maybe once or twice a day. The color is gorgeous and I'm a light, brown-skinned woman. Trust me, you'll love this seductive, deep red hue. It's a mysterious color and I love it!",2022-03-16 04:36:20.482041
