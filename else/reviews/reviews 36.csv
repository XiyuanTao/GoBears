        VINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,"First impressions with shampoo can say a lot, and my impression of this shampoo is really very good! I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and plan to keep it in my routine for the foreseeable future. It works really well and is very affordable compared to my previous shampoo. I have natural wavy/curly hair but I've always lacked volume and body. My hair is just too heavy and there's too much of it (even when short) to get lift from my scalp without using heat.",2022-03-16 01:54:43.155703

This time I knew I was getting low and went ahead and ordered it from Amazon. Itâ€™s not remotely the same shampoo. Instead of giving my hair a nice shine and volume, it made my hair flat, greasy, and generally dirty looking. The most obvious sign something is off is there is no smell. Like most Giovanni shampoos this should have a great smell, in this case it should be very citrusyâ€¦ but thereâ€™s nothing at all.",2022-03-16 01:54:43.155703

Cash,,Verified Purchase,,"I love the smell of this product and used it with the conditioner.  It did give good volume to my hair. But after using it and the conditioner for about 2 weeks, my scalp began to itch constantly.  Then welps developed on my scalp.  Next the itching and welping began on my back.  I had to see a dermatologist and after stopping the use of the product for about 2 weeks the itching and welps began to subside.  I had an allergic reaction and I have never had allergic reactions to other products.",2022-03-16 01:54:43.155703

Unfortunately, although this shampoo smells great, it dried up my hair like no other shampoo has ever done before. it took a week of using a moisture rich shampoo to get my hair back to even close to feeling like where it was before.

I have tried several shampoos and it either dries out my hair or has lots of ingredients I donâ€™t want in it. The first day using this shampoo and doing nothing but letting my hair dry I received a compliment about how nice my hair looked. It makes my hair feel SO much better.
