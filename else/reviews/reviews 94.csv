My face had dried out so much from using Neutrogena face wash. I am 40, so you already know, dry skin is a pain. I've been using this soap for only 3 days, and the difference is remarkable. My skin doesn't feel dry. Also, used it on my hair, it is amazing for dry scalp. No flakes here my dear!",2022-03-16 03:18:57.394645

This is NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN. The soap itself contains like little sand or crystal things to help exfoliate skin BUT IT SCRATCHES. After trying it out for the first time it left painful scratches on my back and legs.  It also doesn't smell good compared to other brands. Don't buy it!!,2022-03-16 03:18:57.394645
