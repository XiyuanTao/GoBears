It always leaks a little shipping but I travel with it and it always leaks on me too so I can't fault them! I use the lavender scent in the winter and the tea tree eucalyptus in supper in Hope's of warding off mosquitos! I wash my face and body with this and sometimes my hair also! It's my go to for traveling because I only need this and conditioner! I also love that it is fair trade and that they list the companies impact on the bottles and have enjoyed watching the numbers go up over the time I've used their products!,2022-03-16 02:49:28.794011

I use it for shampoo and it has reduced my hair loss and has also helped my dry scalp. I use it twice a week and noticed a difference within two weeks. The smell is nice and I do feel the tingle from Eucalyptus but not too much but I still like it. I like how it really cleans my hair, I have thick hair and can go a week without washing and this shampoo cleans the buildup without making it too dry.",2022-03-16 02:49:28.794011
B00NT0GV6U,2022,3,16,4,Great Black Soap,5.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2021",phdorgchem,,Verified Purchase,,"Finally found a great black soap that works well on skin! Contains tea tree oil and eucalyptus so it provides antiseptic value. Family members have used it and it has helped clear acne, breakouts, and skin related rashes from jock itch etc. It doesn't seem to dry skin. You will notice a slight medicinal smell upon dispensing from tea tree oil and Eucalyptus but that is to be expected. Don't expect it to lather like store soaps but it CLEANS VERY well! I bought the bottle with the pump, it doesn't come with one anymore. I recommend you get a pump dispenser to place on the bottle. Will make it very easy to dispense in shower. If your skin feels oily and dirty or sticky....wash with this! Does a fantastic job! I used to use Nubian but they sold out to a large company and changed all the formula's which make it HORRIBLE. So I stopped using it and moved to this. Highly recommend and I hope they continue to LEAVE the formula intact and DON'T sell out to a large company! GREAT standard soap product and I hope they continue to support the groups and families like they say they do on the side of the bottle!",2022-03-16 02:49:28.794011
B00NT0GV6U,2022,3,16,5,Awesome!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2021",Brooke,,Verified Purchase,,"I have 3a curls and if I ever want them to look nice I have to put product upon product on, which might have something to do with the fact I only shower at night so I sleep on them wet but thatâ€™s not the point, Iâ€™ve used this stuff only twice and my curls are so pretty! The product moisturized my hair and I can already feel a texture difference! There is also literally little to no frizz at all. I did end up using it as a face wash because I forgot mine outside of the shower and I was too lazy to get it and so I used it because it says on the bottle it can be used as a face wash and my skin was legitimately clear by the morning. I had an acne scar that wouldnâ€™t go away and two pimples that were killing my self esteem and after washing my face it felt amazing and in the morning the scar had faded to practically nothing and the pimples were completely gone! Sorry long and annoying but I am in love with this product!",2022-03-16 02:49:28.794011

This soap is what got me hooked on African black soap. I have never had dry skin issues but after using Castile soap for a few days I developed eczema for the first time in my life. I tried all know nds of cream and soaps but nothing helped untill I tried alaffia's black soap and I was shocked at the immediate effect it had on my skin. My eczema was immediately soothed, skin became a little softer and was able to respond to the cream I had put on. Overall this is a great soap you won't regret buying it.",2022-03-16 02:49:28.794011
