It didn't really matter that they were biodegradable because we have to pack everything out anyway; they're also faintly fragrant, so we kept them in a bear can the whole time. But they were wonderful for cleaning our faces, underarms, etc. I unfortunately had to deal with breakthrough bleeding for most of the trip, and I used these wipes regularly to clean up--and I never experienced any kind of irritation or problem! I'm normally a little sensitive to irritants. What a relief.",2022-03-16 02:45:07.103105

It did not irritate my skin (which is very sensitive), but I didn't care for the smell and probably wouldn't purchase it again.",2022-03-16 02:45:07.103105

Worked very well, thick and soft. A great product. Only problem is that wipes come in non resealable pack. Only used a couple, unfortunately I did not have a zip lock bag to to put rest of wipes in. The rest dried out by the third day and were wasted. This flaw needs to be fixed. Take a zip lock bag if you do not plan on using all of them at once.",2022-03-16 02:45:07.103105

I guess if you are tough you take a shower or jump in a pond.  Me, I'm not tough - so I settled for body wipes.  Admittedly cold when they come out of the package, but quick to warm up.  The Combat wipes came out of the package easily and maintained their moisture content once the package was open for about 16 days at which time the package was fully consumed.  They did a fine job of removing sweat and grime, and no one complained about being in my vicinity - at least they were too polite to say anything.  The wipes were a great alternative to showering where there was no guarantee of warm or hot water and no place to dry office without freezing.",2022-03-16 02:45:07.103105
