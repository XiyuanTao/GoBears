B00PL15X96,2022,3,16,1,Not the “original” shade I was searching for,1.0 out of 5 stars,10 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2020",Patricia Brugioni,,Verified Purchase,,"I have been looking for the original chestnut rose Lolita shade from before they changed it maybe a couple years ago, and I thought this was it, since it says it’s “original” and is so pricey, but sadly it’s not. This has a more purplish tone, and not the soft, chestnut rose coloring of the original which made it my favorite shade ever. I’m sure this is the perfect shade for some, but not for me. I’ll definitely be more careful when shopping. I shared the difference in coloring between the old and the new. In the second photo, the lower shade is the original Lolita I was looking for, and the top is this shade.",2022-03-16 05:18:02.340788

I am very sensitive to may lipsticks or lip glass practically everything makes my lips peel. This leave my lips feeling smooth I apply a little or later it a couple times if I want to go darker either way looks amazing!! Defiantly buying a back up.

The texture is rich  and smooth.  It goes on and stays on.  I think it has a bit of long lasting stain as my lips look beautiful even by midday after several cups of coffee.  It has a delicious, subtle flavor and scent that is fruit and floral based.  I’ve bought other colors as well.  This one is a beautiful subtle red that will work with any skin tone.",2022-03-16 05:18:02.340788

Like an amped up natural lip color for me (fairly light skin). I love that a little goes a long way, but you can get a darker color if you use more. I get why it's expensive. It'll take me a long time to use it since I like applying it lightly. It's almost like a stain and not sticky or creamy, which I like.",2022-03-16 05:18:02.340788

Well...I immediately see what all the hype is about. The shade is darker than I was expecting, but so so flattering. It's very well pigmented with a great matte finish, but it's still creamy (and not drying, like a lot of matte lipsticks). This is my new go-to lip color!",2022-03-16 05:18:02.340788
