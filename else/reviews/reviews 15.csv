I have 4c,or 4z hair. Age, medication and menopause have turned my hair into a dry, brittle, tangled mess. No matter how gently I tried to detangle my hair, it still  hurt like heck and broke off a ton of hair. I have been natural for almost 20 years and this is the best product I have ever used. It has true ""slip""!!! I was almost ready to cut my below shoulder length hair to a TWA because I was just tired of fighting with my hair. This product is slippery, moisturizing and everything my hair needs to keep me from crying on wash day.  I was sceptical of paying the $14.99 price, but IT IS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY.  I wish this had been invented when I was little girl, then my Mom wouldn't have had to chase me on wash day.  I don't know if this will work for everyone, but it sure works for me.  African Pride, thank you",2022-03-16 01:19:16.697015

Needless to say I was NOT happy about that. However, once I put this pre-poo on my hair that disappointment quickly subsided! I did the big chop over 4 years ago and have been experimenting with products and styles ever since. I created a pre-poo about 2 years ago that my hair absolutely LOVES. (honey/coconut milk/avocado, etc.) I never thought I would find a pre-poo that my hair loved just as much but I was so wrong. This is just amazing, my curls were poppin' and even after washing it out my hair remained soft and manageable. Lets just say my 4C hair is very picky!",2022-03-16 01:19:16.697015
