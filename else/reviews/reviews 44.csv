Poor product,1.0 out of 5 stars,642 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2020",Ben S,,Verified Purchase,,Tried this out and can't even tell I'm bathing with anything except for the smell.  You will end up using alot as it seems to not spread well either while at the same time a dab of water comes right off.,2022-03-16 02:17:44.521686

I smelled the sea buckthorn and peppermint oil only. I tried this after using Purely Northwest and Remedy Tea Tree bodywashes. I will be going back to those as this one broke me out in a rash. I suffer from eczema and psoriasis - this bodywash just made my skin more irritated and itchy. It will be going back if I can remember to send it.,2022-03-16 02:17:44.521686

Watered down, diluted version of Tea Tree wash",1.0 out of 5 stars,124 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2019",Ducu,,Verified Purchase,,"Best way to describe it, this is the watered down, diluted version of and any decent Tea Tree wash. When you buy the anything with Tea Tree, you buy for its potent fragrance and the cooling sensation that it provides after the shower, bath and this product doesn’t provide that. Like I said, as if someone took a half bottle of the actual Tea Tree wash and added half a bottle water in it. NO GOOD!!!",2022-03-16 02:17:44.521686
B07HHHMJ6V,2022,3,16,5,A months review. Got rid of rash and i feel so clean!,5.0 out of 5 stars,81 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2019",therose,,Verified Purchase,,I have had this for about a month. The bottle is 2/3 empty. I have problems with my skin turning to rash if i don't care for it every day. I believe it is a type of yeast infection all where my panties touch especially the elastic. At first I was skeptical. Ceptahil was a mikd wash but i didn't feel it helped it. First two days i was just not sure. But now I am. This is good stuff. It tingles a little bit. But no sign of any skin problems where i am applying it. Now I am washing almost all with this. It keeps me clean longer.,2022-03-16 02:17:44.521686

It smells mildly of tea tree oil.  People looking for very strong tea tree content will need to keep this in mind.  The bottle and pump are good quality - very convenient in the shower.,2022-03-16 02:17:44.521686
