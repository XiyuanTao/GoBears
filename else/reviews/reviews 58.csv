You need this if you have eczema. This stuff has CHANGED my life. I have tried EVERYTHING under the sun. This is just AMAZING. I have gone through an entire bottle and just ordered my next, it took about 2 weeks to completely clear my eczema. I mean CLEAR it completely when I was suffering for MONTHS. I use this with the goldsbond eczema relief cream right out of the shower. You are golden. For itchier spots just use the hydrocortisone with aloe and that’s all. I’m telling you that this has been a God sent. Worth EVERY cent.",2022-03-16 02:33:14.110938

A little goes a long way and it doesn’t foam so it doesn’t strip your skin. I’ve been struggling with a lot of stress/anxiety for the past few days and I developed itchy hives because of it. I used this body wash to help with the itchiness and it really did help my skin a lot! My skin instantly felt soothed. I recommend this to anyone with dry skin or eczema!!!,2022-03-16 02:33:14.110938

B08BB5XH8J,2022,3,16,5,Not the best,3.0 out of 5 stars,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2021",Kendall Cook,,Verified Purchase,,I like the idea of this product. I've struggled with eczema for over 20 years and recently moved to a new state that has very harsh water. My skin was breaking out really badly so I tried this wash. I was not a huge fan. I felt like I had to use so much of it to cover my body since it doesn't foam. And it's so expensive that I would hope I wouldn't have to use that much. My skin was not dried out after the shower but this product was not worth the money in my opinion. I ended up not even using the whole bottle and just buying charcoal bar soap that has worked much better for me.,2022-03-16 02:33:14.110938

Lear,,Verified Purchase,,"I recently purchased this body wash because of my dry, eczema-prone skin at my sister’s recommendation.  What I didn’t know about it is that it does not suds when you use it to bathe. Not one bubble! I did use it once but could not tell whether I actually was putting it on my skin or not due to the fact that you can’t see it. I felt that I would go through the entire bottle in a short period of time due to constantly re-applying it to my bath mitt. I did not like this product at all because of the no-suds factor. I have to say that it did do a good job in that my skin did not itch when I got out of the shower. However I will not use it again and would only recommend it to anyone who doesn’t mind that it doesn’t make suds.",2022-03-16 02:33:14.110938

Went to my doctor and said that I have a mild form of Eczema. got recommened this product and a prescription cream. I gotta say, this has worked wonders. 2 weeks of non stop itch and taking antihistamine since I thought I have allergies, when all I really needed was this! Just 3 days of using it so far and bam, the itch is almost entirely gone and I can sleep at  night again, 90% itch free. Plus, I feel like my skin is extra moisturized and feels nice and smooth/softer to the touch the before. Highly recommend! I also apply the Eucerin Eczema Relief cream for extra protection",2022-03-16 02:33:14.110938
