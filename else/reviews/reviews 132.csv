My favorite nude from a department store brand got discontinued and ever since I’ve been hopelessly searching for my everyday lipstick. The pigmentation isn’t the same but that’s to be expected for maybelline. Seems to be moisturizing enough. Who cares if you have to reapply if the price is so low?

It looks darker in the tube, but because of the frost, it is a good shade or two lighter on the lips. I actually really enjoy this. It's very comfortable to wear. It is not a smelly lipstick. (I've had some strong chemical/plastic smelling ones in the past.) I was looking for a ""nude"" color and this one works for lighter skin. Would recommend!",2022-03-16 04:07:43.095123

        HALL OF FAMETOP 100 REVIEWER",Verified Purchase,,"I have never had a good experience with Maybelline bullet lipsticks, because they're all too sheer and slippery-----but Rum Riche is much better than the other shades I've tried in the past few weeks (e.g. Siren in Scarlet, Infra Red, Vibrant Violet) due to the opacity and the ability to stay where you put it without sliding off your face.",2022-03-16 04:07:43.095123

I have blue eyes, blonde hair, and a light/medium skin tone, and this shade is a great match for my coloring.  It is just a tad darker than a true, Hollywood type red.  It is not a wine color, or a fire engine red with orange tones - it is just a classic, bright red.",2022-03-16 04:07:43.095123

The darker edges of the lipstick case is what I hoped to find, but the center color of the lipstick case is what you will find, if you purchase the ""red rival"" lipstick . I wish the sellers would use something like a color wheel, if they want to gain the buyer's trust when making a future purchase. Don't just do a copy and paste of any red or whatever shade you're selling. You might as well not have a photo at all. How hard is it to smear the color on a white sheet of paper, shine a bright light on it and take a stinkin pic of it. Wow.",2022-03-16 04:07:43.095123
