B01DYV0REK,2022,3,16,1,DRY!.... you get what you pay for.....,1.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2021",Amazon Customer,,Verified Purchase,,"This lipstick is really low end. Yes, they are cheap and I know I‚Äôm not buying MAC... but yikes. This lipstick is bottom of the barrel bad. The color is blah/okay..meh... but the texture. DRY!  I wore this for 1 day and tossed it. It dried my lips out so bad in that 1 day, that I had to wear only Vaseline for the 3 days after. ... just to rehydrate them. There are plenty of matte lipsticks out there that don‚Äôt dry like this brand. You really get what you pay for.",2022-03-16 05:20:30.032679
