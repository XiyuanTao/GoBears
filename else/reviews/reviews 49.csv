My husband was given a bottle of this foaming cleanser during a post-surgical hospital stay and I gave it a try.  It is fabulous for times when I do not want to, or cannot, take a shower but want to freshen up.  It's also great for an evening face cleanser.  It does a great job of eliminating odors, gently cleaning skin, and it smells pleasant, a bit like vanilla to me.",2022-03-16 02:20:54.537937

It is order free, soft and does a good job cleaning.  It dispenses as a foam but that foam does not immediately disappear when in contact with water like many other foams.  So there is some cleansing action and some rinsing needed.  I'm using it in place of Dove soap to tell you how gentle it is.",2022-03-16 02:20:54.537937
