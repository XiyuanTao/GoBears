As someone who has tried many other products with salicylic acid that either stink, leave your skin kinda dry and still don’t help much at all.",2022-03-16 03:20:00.873233

He has been struggling with back and chest acne for the last year.  He had been using an over the counter acne body wash and a prescription lotion.  With limited results.  The first week of using the Black Wolf body wash, we began to see results.  They have only gotten better as the weeks have progressed.  I would highly recommend this product.",2022-03-16 03:20:00.873233
B08GMCPT5H,2022,3,16,5,Best. Bodywash. Ever.,5.0 out of 5 stars,9 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2021",Mike,,Verified Purchase,,"I was on a search for a long time to find a body wash I liked. I've always suffered with severe breakouts on my back and have spent tons of money on Acne products that never seem to work long-run. I've somewhat contributed to the worse parts of that bad acne to bad body wash. So the search was on to find the perfect body wash for multiple reasons - better more organic ingredients, better more natural smell (vs that fabricated scent that doesn't last long or makes you gag), easy on my skin (to potentially lessen my back acne), and doesn't leave a ""slimy"" or ""sticky"" residue behind - just to name a few. I've spent a lot of money on different ""organic"", sea salt heavy or charcoal based gel & barred body wash/soaps. None of them have met all the needs I personally wanted until I found this Black Wolf Nation charcoal body wash. It smells greats, lathers well, gets me clean, is easy on my skin & leaves zero residue behind after rinsing. And the best, most unexpected part about this since switching almost 2 months ago is that I've had to use ZERO other acne products on my back and it's cleared up better than I can ever remember! I would recommend this product 10 times over to anyone looking to replace their Dove, AOS, Nivea, Axe, Old Spice or any other horribly chemical ridden body washes.",2022-03-16 03:20:00.873233
B08GMCPT5H,2022,3,16,6,Very Nice,5.0 out of 5 stars,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020",Dorian Salomon,,Verified Purchase,,"Every once in awhile I break out with acne on my back and I use an organic product that my family made but I am away for college and can't really access anymore at the moment. Funny thing is I saw this product advertised on Instagram. I thought it would be another scam but I saw it here on amazon and decided to try this product. Upon opening this package the container smelt like skunk. Don't fret, the scent immediately goes away. The actual scent of the body wash smells very nice and applies smooth on the body. The feeling after using this was amazing. My back wasn't oily and the product did not make my back break out. I plan on buying the face wash of the product as well.",2022-03-16 03:20:00.873233
