I have been using Joico products for the last 12 years. Very rarely I try some other brands but every time I go back to Joico because it is the best. It doesn't make your hair heavy, so you don't need clarifying shampoo, and the smell is very nice. I bought the big bottles, so I got a good deal. No issues whatsoever with the scalp. And yes, no pump, and I threw my old bottles without saving the pump. But with the conditioner is simple, you only use one squirt. For the shampoo I bought a soap dispenser. It works. No complaint there. Also, I knew it didn't come with a pump. It's not important because I am interested with the quality of the product, not the packing.",2022-03-16 01:26:41.627001

This is definitely not the same as from the salon, it’s much more watery. However, I still gave it 3 stars because it smells similar and washes my hair the same although I have to use a much larger amount each time. They probably just water it down. So it works but I’d trust getting it from a salon more",2022-03-16 01:26:41.627001

I purchased this item from this reseller because this showed a PUMP. Apparently I'm not the only one with this problem. I knew I wanted this product so I didn't look at the comments prior to purchase. The product from the manufacturer is great but this only gets 1 star because it didn't come with a PUMP and that was the ONLY reason I purchased from this reseller.

She was absolutely right! A little goes a long ways and it smells amazing. I was losing handfuls of hair previously and now I barely lose any at all. So my hair is coming back thicker and it's actually finally getting a bit of length. Color has lasted really well. I love it.,2022-03-16 01:26:41.627001

I have scalp issues with less expensive drugstore shampoos but Joico's has been consistently excellent. My hairdresser uses it and I had her order my first bottle, which came as a set with the conditioner, which I don't need to reorder yet - and thankfully have now found the shampoo at a good price on Amazon. Buyer beware however, the seller showed the 33.8 oz size coming with a pump and it is NOT included. Fortunately I had kept the old pump from first bottle.",2022-03-16 01:26:41.627001

I know joico is a good brand and I decided to try the shampoo but it felt really heavy on my hair and it made it look somewhat oily or just heavy/without volume. I regret buying such a big bottle because I ha fro give it away. I recommend their hair mask but would suggest you try the shampoo in a smaller size first, specially if you have fine hair like mine.",2022-03-16 01:26:41.627001
