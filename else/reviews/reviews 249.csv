It is however way cheaper than any alternative to provide bluetooth radio and phone on an older car.,2022-03-16 05:57:35.435399

Great media receiver for the price. A few things worthy of mentioning to write a helpful review. For my car (Toyota Prius), the unit appears to match up with standard double DIN size, however, the framing around the factory radio exceeds the standard size, resulting in a big gap. It's about an inch and  half difference or 3/4 in on each side. This makes it impossible regardless of the mounting kit used to eliminate the gap because some of the factory framing is attached to the original radio. In my case, unless I bought the $100 harness, I would lose the temperature and steering wheel controls, so I bought Toyota harnesses that match up to the new one and attached the remaining factory harness back into the factory radio. Basically, as a cheap solution, I have to leave the unusable factory radio mounted and this new one underneath it. Point being, at least with my car, there was no way to mount this thing without it looking awkward.",2022-03-16 05:57:35.435399
