This can be used anywhere you have a tendency to get dead skin or acne. It has gentle acids for the body. If you want more physical exfoliation, I recommend using a loofa with it. I suggest that you don't buy the exfoliators products that have beads or salt because they are not safe to use and can damage the natural skin barrier as well as cause more a threat to the marine life in the oceans.",2022-03-16 02:18:15.811962

        TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I want to say this before anything else, in case all you read is the first part...I don’t know why they called this an “Exfoliating Body Cleanser.” It kind of gives off the wrong idea. A body cleanser is something that I use every day on my whole body. An exfoliator is something I use a couple times a week in specific areas where I feel like I need exfoliation. I don’t feel like exfoliation is needed on my entire body. For me, I don’t think an exfoliator should be used as a body cleanser like soap or a body wash. It should be used in specific areas. But, others might feel differently or like their whole body needs exfoliators. There is more on this throughout the rest of the review, but I just wanted to make sure I put this part at the beginning.",2022-03-16 02:18:15.811962
