B09DJ9DHXK,2022,3,16,4,good curl definition but no volume (3.5 stars overall),3.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2021",jeanneserenity,,,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I would give this line an overall score of 3.5.  I tried three products: the Curl Fresh Shampoo, Conditioner and  Definer.  I liked the shampoo the best.  My hair felt clean and it didn't take much product.  The conditioner was OK.  I didn't feel like it gave my curls enough slip and they didn't feel as moisturized. I also felt like I used a lot of the product. The definer is a thin cream that went on smooth and didn't feel sticky.  I didn't feel like it added much.  I did three washes with these (two with all three products followed by my usual gel and one without the definer using my regular styling cream and gel).",2022-03-16 01:11:02.876457

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"AG is one of the premium brands for curly and wavy hair, and this is a pretty good ""curly girl"" shampoo with proteins and *without* harsh sulfates, cleansers, or silicones. I was happy to find that it lacks both coconut and aloe, since my hair is sensitive to those. Its proteins are small (amino acids), so good for both low- and high-porosity hair. Overall this shampoo works well, but I find that other shampoos have comparable ingredient profiles and work equally well for the price. Typically shampoo doesn't sit on your hair long enough for many proteins to stick around, so if you're on a budget I'd focus on an AG conditioner or leave-in rather than their shampoo per se",2022-03-16 01:11:02.876457
