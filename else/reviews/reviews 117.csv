It is an amazing product but this is the first time I have bought and used the triple milled soap. The bar of soap is so much bigger in size and thicker too. The lather is just as good as if I was using the regular goat milk soap which to point out is a great lather. The scent is hardly to none since it is unscented, because I know that when you get an unscented soap, there is a hint of a smell to it but not with this triple milled.",2022-03-16 03:35:34.147843

B082L5TQ4M,2022,3,16,3,Fantastic Soap!,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2021",Loves old books,,Verified Purchase,,"After seeking a USA-sourced and produced soap, because I distrust many of the imported products that are on the market, I purchased this soap from Amazon -- I will never go back to the grocery-store soaps I have used for decades! ""Quality"" is written all over this product -- from the heavenly scent, to the lovely, sudsy texture, to the integrity of the bar and how well it holds up to water. I think the soap is extremely reasonably priced given the size of the bar and its exceptional quality. The wonderful scent makes a daily shower or bath something to anticipate! I can also say that, after using it for just a week, I could not believe how much softer and less dry my skin was. It seems that every time I use the soap my skin is in better conditioner than the day before, as though the effects of this lovely soap are cumulative. As long as Legends Creek continues to make this product from all-natural ingredients that are USA sourced, I will be a happy customer!",2022-03-16 03:35:34.147843

I Love the triple milked soap as it lasts for a very long time.  I like that  it is environmentally friendly because there is no plastic container to dispose of when it's done. Seems to be skin friendly and rinses off really well. I really enjoy using this in my shower.,2022-03-16 03:35:34.147843

I looked and found this wonderful company that makes the soap on their farm.  All you need is a little water on your hands and the lather is incredible.  My face and skin has never felt better!  After using this on my face, no more tight skin after a bath.  The size of the bar is amazing as well.  I purchased the soap unscented so there is no perfume or scent, which I wanted.  All in all, I've found my new beauty products as I've already tried the lotion as well and am hooked.  Thank you Legend's Creek Farm!",2022-03-16 03:35:34.147843

My first time to use goat soap. My wife talked me into trying it. I am a believer in goat soap now.. It made my skin feel smooth and comfortable,  not itchy. The bar is really big. I definitely will purchase again before I use this up. I recommend it to everyone.  There is no fragrance at all. I'm sensitive to smells. I bought this to relieve dry itchy skin. It worked.
