Itâ€™s huge. This might be TMI but I use this as a feminine wash and it is the best most gentil thing. Better than any baby wash as well.,2022-03-16 02:12:24.964784

The smell almost knocked me off my feet!  I have COPD with Odor Sensitive issues so I have to be careful what I use.  Thank God I smelled it before I got in the shower and passed out!  Don't write ""Fragrance Free"" if it's NOT!  That scent was stronger than their "" lightly scented"" shower wash.  I'll be returning this.",2022-03-16 02:12:24.964784

B075X2KL5C,2022,3,16,4,This is great fragrance free body wash.,5.0 out of 5 stars,58 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2018",Peggy Lovelace,,Verified Purchase,,I love this Body Wash. It is fragrance free and that is what I want. I am sick of all the fragrances in everything you buy. By the time you are dressed and ready to leave the house... you have on 45 different smells. Thank you Aveeno for this product.  But I do put it outside and let it age about two weeks... that eliminates any absorbed fragrances from other things... GREAT.,2022-03-16 02:12:24.964784

It is like a miracle for me. I've been fighting itchy rashy eczema on my hands and it was spreading to my arms, and I had never had it in my life. This went on for 2 years, and my dermatologist put me on 3 or 4 different creams and/or steroid creams and none worked. I also used at least 10 different natural creams, oils, washes, etc. and NOTHING worked. I even tried fungal creams! Naturally, that didn't work, as it wasn't a fungal rash! Desperate people do desperate things. I love Aveeno products and had tried several, but did not know they had eczema therapy products. I discovered them on Amazon and figured why not try? So I always wash my hands with the special wash (I just put it by my sink, since it's a pump), and I follow up with the Eczema Therapy Moisturizing pump lotion/cream, and I use the thick colloidal cream only at night. Within ONE WEEK, my eczema stopped itching and started to fade! In 2 weeks, it was totally gone! I am ecstatic! I showed my husband and we were both in shock! I mean, I have tried EVERYTHING! Even an expensive honey from New Zealand that did nothing! This is the best most remarkable stuff I ever used and now my hands are soft and totally clear, and I can wear bracelets and rings again! I am getting some for a friend who has way more severe eczema all over than I had, but she's tried everything too, so maybe it could work for her. Good luck, as it has been AMAZING for me!",2022-03-16 02:12:24.964784
B075X2KL5C,2022,3,16,8,REVISED REVIEW,5.0 out of 5 stars,10 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2020",K.,,Verified Purchase,,"Originally I complained about how this is advertised as fragrance-free because this body wash actually HAS A SCENT. It has a scent resembling eucalyptus... Anyway, my partner and I have sensitive skin so we wanted to switch to this body wash because we love Aveeno's line of sensitive skin body lotions. I purchased this as well as several other household toiletries. Right when we used this body wash, we both got red itchy blotchy bumps on random areas of our bodies and we both quickly assumed this body wash was scammed because we previously purchased other products (plural) via Amazon that turned off to be knock-off garbage.",2022-03-16 02:12:24.964784
