B00381A7OW,2022,3,16,2,Has some great effects but....,4.0 out of 5 stars,12 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2019",Phineas,,Verified Purchase,,"I discovered this soap at Costco and I did like it enough to order once it was used.  I am middle-aged and have developed skin tags, since using many tags are totally gone and I not developing new ones.  Remaining tags are very small and not noticeable unless you are looking for them. I did not use this soap for 2 weeks as I was on vacation and did not bring-the skin tags started to return.  My son has mild to moderate acne and the soap has without question helped with this as well.  The scent smells simply like soap and it is not anything special, the lather is ok-again not anything different from other soaps which I have used.  The only negative I have is that the soap is drying-which is most likely why it helps with my son's acne. I do not have overly sensitive skin so I cannot comment on this.  All in all, I like the product and will continue to use.",2022-03-16 02:28:28.396757
B00381A7OW,2022,3,16,3,Finally bodywash that's heals,5.0 out of 5 stars,18 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2018",Luis Villarreal,,Verified Purchase,,"I have been looking for a body wash that didn't leave my skin tight or dry and this is it. I tried dove, dr bronners, black soap, and all these organics but they all made my skin dry and tight. I guess it really does matter about are skin barrier because this product leaves me smooth! No tightness at all or dry. BUT! Not good for my face. My face gets super itchy and sensitive. But works amazing for my body. Healing up all my dry skin and healing folliculitis on my back.there is a little itching it leaves on my elbows but that's it. I use a loofah . Suds up super good. At first I only used my hands but didn't  bubble up that much. So I used to loofa to feel better about it. I guess because we are so used too having that feeling or seeing bubbles. It does smell weird but who cares it leaves my skin smooth. Smells like gel or lemon. Idk but it works. Should last a while I f you use a loofah.i give it a 4 because it irritates face and little itchy on elbows.",2022-03-16 02:28:28.396757
B00381A7OW,2022,3,16,4,It works!,5.0 out of 5 stars,6 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019",JMGW,,Verified Purchase,,"Found this at Costco, got a bottle from the sales rep, and now loyally buy it from Amazon to wash my face. I had a patch of eczema on my lower chin for years. This provided instant itch relief from the first time I used it; like nothing else has in the past - not even steroid cream. I flared up more in winter, but since I started using it, I’ve never had the patch on my chin appear again. Now I can shave my beard confidently when I want to be clean shaven and seem to never again have to worry about that red, flaky patch, and subsequently, dry skin dropping off onto the front of my shirt. I love this product!",2022-03-16 02:28:28.396757

Started using this about 6 weeks ago and noticed that my skin does not dry out anymore after a shower, my complexion is brighter and more even toned, and the blotchiness is gone! I put it on a loofah sponge and use all over the body, but put use only my fingers for my face with just one tiny pump (about half the size of a dime) and it is more than enough for my face and neck. The item comes with a pump that is so easy to use (just one hand can operate the pump and receive the soap at the same time). The texture of the cleanser is very smooth, creamy and has this translucent quality to it. Looks like liquid emerald. It has a clean scent...no overpowering or annoying fragrances, and it rinsed off very well, leaving a clean and dewy feeling. Had to opt for a steady supply of this via the subscribe option. Amazon had it at the cheapest price as i conpared with 3 stores and 4 online sources. I am very pleased.",2022-03-16 02:28:28.396757

Yes it is made of chemicals. Yes it ever so slightly dries the skin. Yes is has a faint fragrance (probably to mask the fact that it IS made up of chemicals).  BUT IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS!  If your skin is dry after you use it, use something afterwards, no problem. This is not only hypoallergenic it is ANTI-allergenic. Thank you Sebamed!",2022-03-16 02:28:28.396757
