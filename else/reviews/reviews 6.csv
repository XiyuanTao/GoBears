Do not throw it out after the first use it doesn’t work instantly. So let me tell you why I bought this out of no where my head was always itching and I started to lose hair , I could tell I was starting to get bald spots where I was itching. Anyway after the first time I used it, my head slightly burned not like painful tho like after you use tea tree shampoo or something minty...  anyways it was still itchy but calmed down my scalp ... so I would wash it every 2 days with this.. slowly but surely the itching eventually has stopped. by the time I ran out of this bottle I didn’t need to buy it anymore I’ve gone back to regular shampoo at the store since. It definitely works well for at least the itchiness I was experiencing and also I am no longer losing my hair too ... definitely give this a if you are experiencing symptoms like mine ,it’s worth a shot",2022-03-16 01:10:06.812556
B07RZ9B33D,2022,3,16,2,ProBliva Fungus Shampoo REALLY WORKS!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,61 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2021",Will Dickie,,Verified Purchase,,"Amazing Product! This scalp shampoo does everything it says it will and more.  I've used numerous scalp shampoos in an effort to sooth my super itchy scalp and to remove the small scabs that ""would"" but no longer developed all over my scalp. I've been using T-Sal and I'd also scrub my scalp with a soft scrub brush. While this approach helped to scale back the itching, it still didn't get rid of all the itching and I still had scabs forming on my scalp as well. I also used Scalpacin anti-itch liquid and while that too helped but I still had constant itching and scabs arbitrarily forming on my scalp. Finally, I saw this ProBliva Fungus Shampoo online - after reading the reviews I decided to purchase ProBliva Fungus Shampoo and give it a go - I couldn't be happier with the results! After just one application my scalp felt noticeably better. After a week of using Pro Bolivar my scalp feels entirely normal - NO ITCHING WHATSOEVER AND ALL THE SCABS HAVE HEALED UP AND GONE AWAY! It's like a miracle  - and my hair has been revitalized, remoisturized and now looks and feels silky soft and super healthy! Oh man - I wish I would had found ProBliva years ago and saved myself 15 years of misery.",2022-03-16 01:10:06.812556

I wash my hair once with regular shampoo & then I rinse and lather up with this shampoo. I leave it in during my shower.  My hair doesn't get greasy & itch or have little pimples develop. The hair issues started after going through CHEMO & losing all of my hair. What a relief, but since I will have to take a cancer pill every day I imagine I will be using this shampoo for the duration.",2022-03-16 01:10:06.812556

Scabs, flakes, incredibly itchy, the full nine... I had tried a few things before finally ending up on this. I figured I must have something like a fungus because it was completely out of control. I also have hard water so it wasn’t helping the problem. Anyway, I used this and it was the first time I’d seen any improvements in my scalp. I’m so glad I found this. I’ve used it about 3 times (I wash my hair about 1-2x a week) and I can finally say I have very little to almost no dandruff left. I am currently using a different shampoo though because this one is sooooo drying but that’s to be expected I guess. I had major issues and only a really rough shampoo could’ve helped and this one helped me.",2022-03-16 01:10:06.812556

Zero results for what it claims to do in the product description. I know how frustrating this condition and and how much we are willing to spend. Do Not buy this product.
