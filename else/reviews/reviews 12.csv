Lost 2 stars because of it. I was expecting a pleasant smell like the other Milkshake products I have used. Maybe this was old stock? I'm using it anyway as I don't want to throw my money down the drain. The conditioner smells just as bad! Aside from the horrid smell, it seems to work well.  Most products weigh my hair down and this doesn't. It leaves my hair feeling light and super soft. Helps control the flyaways and leaves my hair manageable.  I just wish the smell wasn't so bad. I doubt I'll order this again due the strong plastic odor.",2022-03-16 01:15:19.344200
