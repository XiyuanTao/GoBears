B07Q3816PS,2022,3,16,1,Great lipstick,3.0 out of 5 stars,9 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2020",Shae Grider,,Verified Purchase,,"I love this lipstick. Looks great on and last almost all day. I gave three stars though cause for the price you don‚Äôt get much if your expecting the bottom to screw up for more lipstick think again, once you take the top off what you see is what you get. If you use lipstick on the daily and are on a budget....I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this product.",2022-03-16 05:28:28.331206

It's my favorite color and piles on nicely. Only thing I would change is making it moisturizing like some Real Her has. Wish there was more lipstick also. But overall still a great lipstick.,2022-03-16 05:28:28.331206

However, every time I put this on my lips, it‚Äôs burns. I thought at first that my lips probably had tiny cuts or something but after using it a 3rd time & the same thing happened.... I know now that it‚Äôs the product and now it‚Äôs too late to return it ‚òπÔ∏è",2022-03-16 05:28:28.331206
B07Q3816PS,2022,3,16,5,I‚Äôm obsessed with this lipstick.,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2022",Dr. Elmo,,Verified Purchase,,"I first got this product in one of those beauty sample subscriptions. I have since ordered every color, but the Viola is by far my favorite. It glides on easily, the color is amazing, and it lasts forever even with eating, drinking, and mask wearing. Doesn‚Äôt creep into the wrinkles around my mouth. I can use lip balm over it to alleviate the inevitable dryness of long-lasting lipstick. Highly recommended.",2022-03-16 05:28:28.331206
B07Q3816PS,2022,3,16,6,It‚Äôs nice,4.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2022",Yuyu ,,Verified Purchase,,It‚Äôs a darker shade with a main brown nude color with a bit of a pink red undertone in it as well. Definitely need to wear it with a full face of makeup. Not a natural color. The pencil glides the color on very smoothly and it stays ok and doesn‚Äôt get on your mask or anything since it‚Äôs matte. It came with a sharpener so you can sharpen it. It‚Äôs a good and pretty sharpener with two holes the smaller one you can use for your lip liners! :) This one was $11 all together not too bad. Some other sugar shades are more pricey. Hope this review helps. I bought this because I wanted to try a dark bold color and see how that would look on me. Def stands out.,2022-03-16 05:28:28.331206

The cap came off and ruined my purse, my shirt and my hands. I was digging around in my purse trying to find my wallet and the shit got everywhere!!! Avoiding the but word.....I love the colors; I have 3. They stay on all day and you can use chapstick on top without ruining the color. It‚Äôs super matte, although not true to color on amazon, they are super pretty. Just make sure you put them in their own bag. Ziplock snack bags work best! Lesson learned.",2022-03-16 05:28:28.331206

You want a classic 1920-1940s RED lip? Then this is the color for you. It also comes with a sharpener so you can keep using it even when it gets low. Brilliant!,2022-03-16 05:28:28.331206
