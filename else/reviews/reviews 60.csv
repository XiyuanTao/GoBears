My doctor suggested this soap to treat a rash. Evidently it has some medicinal qualities. Since she has more degrees than a thermometer, I trust her judgement. Being a spokesman for the under-educated, I can only tell you about my experience. It suds up pretty easy & it smells great! I highly recommend this product.

I find the soap cracks lengthwise very quickly.  The other very odd aspect is it retains dirt!  The dirt clings to the soap - hold it under water and it doesn't rinse away!  No grease, nor anything unusual but when the soap is used as hand soap, the soap holds on to the dirt, doesn't rinse off, and looks disgusting.  I wld only purchase this as an absolute emergency with no other soap under the sun available.",2022-03-16 02:36:52.064894
