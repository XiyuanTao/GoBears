And even though the bottle elsewhere states No Sulfates, this sticker has many chemicals like, Sodium Sulfonate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, and so on. Sounds like versions of Sulfates to me. Also made my scalp itch which is what led me to get the magnifying glass out. Now wondering if this is the authentic product because there are also many good reviews too.",2022-03-16 01:13:20.746121

I would get a lot of dandruff and sores on my head. I was allergic to head and shoulders, seemed like any shampoo I used for a period of time would make my head worse. I used selson blue for a while until my scalp rejected that also, I tried this mint shampoo straight from the salon, no such luck. Found T-Sal and that didnt work. T-Gel seemed to work the longest and then I started getting bad dandruff and an itchy/scabby scalp again. Dr then prescribed me some ketamine shampoo but that didnt touch the problem. She then recommended this shampoo and thought maybe I'm just very sensitive to sulfate. So far so good! My hair is fluffy, I'm not itchy, and I havent seen any dandruff. Will update if anything changes down the road!",2022-03-16 01:13:20.746121

I have never bought a shampoo/conditioner system that actually did what it was claiming to do until now. My hair was so damaged from repeated bleaching and dying it felt like straw.
