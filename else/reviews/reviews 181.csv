        TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I really love how this feels on my lips -- it's light and doesn't dry out my lips like typical matte lipsticks. It goes on smooth and the color looks good, not blotchy. The only thing I don't like is that all of their colors seem to be more orange than expected. I ordered a color that looked like a pink mauve but ended up being more orange. I ordered another product from them and it was the same, so be aware that their colors tend to skew orange a bit. Other than that, the formula is really nice and feels good on your lips.",2022-03-16 05:03:22.978601

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"This is a review for the COLORKEY Airy Velvet Lip Lacquer Lightweight Matte Liquid Lipstick, Soft Matte Lip Cream, Lip Glaze, Long Lasting No Fading Non-stick Cup Lip Gloss (611D). The lipstick  name fits exactly, it really does leave my lips with a velvety texture. The lipstick feels comfortable, it is not sticky, has a powerful and uniform pigmentation, so you must apply it carefully. The duration of the lipstick is reasonable, it is removed with ease, did not dry out my lips, its duration is good weather, several hours, until you eat something or take it off. The price of colorkey airy velvet lip lacquer is a bit high",2022-03-16 05:03:22.978601

        TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"COLORKEY Airy Velvet Lip Lacquer Lightweight Matte Liquid Lipstick really is a light matte.  I was pleasantly surprised to realize how soft and velvety it felt on my lips while I was wearing it.  The lipstick was ethereally lightweight, and the color itself was a beautiful powdery mauve.  The color melted into my lips and stayed for hours, giving my mouth a light stained look.  Highly recommended.",2022-03-16 05:03:22.978601

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"My wife loves this lip tint, especially on video work meetings and when our (vaccinated) family circle gets together.  The color goes on evenly and soaks in quickly for a smooth, professional finish.  The color is very flattering as a cool pink-to-rose tone and goes with just about anything she's wearing.  The color lasts throughout most of the morning before I leave for appointments. The applicator is soft and precise for her needs, and the shape of the tube makes it easy for her to find in her purse - this is a well-designed, quality lip tint product!",2022-03-16 05:03:22.978601

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"This lip color is incredible. Not only is it the perfect orangey red, it also is extremely lightweight and feels like I’m not wearing any lip product. The applicator is the perfect length so that I’m not struggling to follow my lip line like some of the shorter applicators are, and the tube feels high end. My only complaint is that even though it doesn’t need to “dry down”, it also still transfers a lot, nothing some powder can’t help, but definitely not a great feature.",2022-03-16 05:03:22.978601

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I was a little confused when I read the description.  Generally speaking, I do not think of a tint as being shiny which is what I think when I hear glaze.  That being said, it is (in my mind) a decent tint.  It lasts well until I eat - the greasier the meal the more it comes off.  Pretty standard for a tint in my mind.  The color was not as flattering on my as I thought it might be but my teen immediately declared it hers so it did not go to waste.",2022-03-16 05:03:22.978601

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"This is very smooth. It is velvet like. If you've used a lip paint, it's kind of like that. It is a lip gloss in that it never dries. It will come off on your glasses or anything else it touches, but it's not shinny. It looks and feels velvety. The color is very pretty too. And not overwhelming. It's not a heavy thick color.",2022-03-16 05:03:22.978601
