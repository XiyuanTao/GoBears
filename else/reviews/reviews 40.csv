I was skeptical at first but I am desperate for any relief with my recent flare. I used a generous amount on my affected areas, I did not let the product sit there I rinsed it off pretty quick. Typically when getting out of the shower your psoriasis can sting, burn or feel tight. After using this my psoriasis felt nothing which is amazing! It didn’t feel like I had anything. It didn’t really improve the scaling of the skin but it improved the texture and the redness and irritation. I would highly recommend this for someone with severe psoriasis looking to get relief in every possible way.",2022-03-16 02:15:47.228852
B075N8CDGT,2022,3,16,2,Less scaling and prevents dryness. No itching.,5.0 out of 5 stars,50 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2020",Kenneth felipe,,Verified Purchase,,I guess i am guilty of over exfoliating. So my skin tends to dry out more. I followed the directions and used slightly Luke warm water on my body. I rubbed on the effected areas and brushed the skin softly. I left it on for five minutes. There were no scales on my skin. I usually have to scrub and bleed to get it off. There was no burn. I use this in conjunction with CeraVe psoriasis moisturizing cream after I shower. It is not a cure but believe me when I say it has helped immensely. The skin color is not red but lighter. I don’t itch. I sometimes get depress over my skin and dread the shower because i have to brush my skin and look at it. This has softened  blow immensely. I have also stopped taking steroid creams because they no longer work. I am exercising regularly and taking a probiotic. I have been noticing some serious improvements. I love this product. Thank you CeraVe.,2022-03-16 02:15:47.228852

B075N8CDGT,2022,3,16,4,Fragrance free 2% salacylic acid good for acne,5.0 out of 5 stars,30 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2019",stephanie,,Verified Purchase,,I’ve been using this cleanser head to toe for over a year. It’s thin and doesn’t bubble up much no perfume. I use this one because I love that it’s a 2% salacylic acid wash with no added fragrance or dye. It helps with acne and clogged pores and any little bumps or dry flaky skin. When I first started using it my skin was slightly sensitive to it and it would tingle and leave me a little pink. But I got used to it and it doesn’t do that anymore and I’ve been able to add other exfoliating products to my skin care routine while still using this one twice a day. Always use a moisturizer after and sunscreen.,2022-03-16 02:15:47.228852
