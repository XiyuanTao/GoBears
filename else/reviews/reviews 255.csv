B07ZF9FK6W,2022,3,16,1,Promises Match Performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,111 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019",Joseph S. Fichera,,Verified Purchase,,I tried several of these rear view camera systems and had to return all of them.  The promises didnt match the performance.  This system - with a Sony camera and new software managing the light changes - was recommended to me and I am finally satisfied.  The Sony camera makes a big difference and the software adjusts well for the headlight effect - no blinding flare out. See video.  The rearview parking lines need improvement but it's not a deal killer with the core features sharp and functional. I hope/trust they address this in a firmware/software update.  All in all it's a great way to add technology to car without a huge price tag.  The package comes with everything including a 32 GB memory card.,2022-03-16 06:17:59.235367

I didnt know it could get any better but the new size and shape was an improvement! The touchscreen is even more responsive and the camera has more viewing angles than before. Also, the new split screen view is very nice to have. There is a review that says the quality is bad and it turns out blue. This is not true, the person just didnt take off the blue protective film that covers the lens while it's in the package. You have to remove this film before use.

The load time is pretty fast for the blu ray discs to start playing, and with our kids mostly wanting new movie titles, most of the time, they are only available in blu ray.  Another pro is that the connection between screens has a firm connector, rather than just a plug in cord that will keep it tight and not fall out.

After browsing for a while, I stumbled upon this one. I looked at all the features and thought the price was decent so I decided to get it a try. I am glad that I did get it. It was easy to set up and to get started I didn't have to open the instructions manual. I inserted an extra micro SD card that I had lying around, hooked up the USB cable, and it worked right away. It was pretty intuitive. After finally reading the instructions I saw that there is an app for it. I downloaded it and found it easy to use. The pictures and videos in this review were downloaded from the app to my phone. It was easy to do.  The video quality is pretty clear. It records both inside and outside at the same time. The sound quality is also pretty good, however I removed it from the video for privacy reasons. I saw some cams that are way more expensive but I have also saw that are cheaper. I don't know how good those cheap ones really are though. The only negative comment I have is that it doesn't come with the memory card. Maybe they can bump up the price $20 and include one in a future release. So far I definitely recommend this dash cam.",2022-03-16 06:18:55.134762
