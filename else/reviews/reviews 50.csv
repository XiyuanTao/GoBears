It‚Äôs soap and it does what soap does, it gets you clean. It does smell nice and the price is great. But, one thing I really like is the cap. It‚Äôs flat and big enough to hold the bottle upside down so all the product drains down to the cap and you don‚Äôt have to work to get the last bit of soap. I will buy again!",2022-03-16 02:21:46.632496
B07NJNZYQT,2022,3,16,3,Great product for the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,78 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2019",Kathrine Schwartman,,Verified Purchase,,"I have eczema and this product really works well for me. It is very moisturizing and it smells good. A little goes a long way and I have found it lasts longer than body wash you can get at the grocery store. Most importantly, it does not irritate my eczema. I can't say what it would do for other people with skin issues, so please do not generalize what I say to all people with eczema, psoriasis, etc. For me, this really works well.",2022-03-16 02:21:46.632496

I was scared to give it a try but the price, 2-day delivery and ease of purchase compelled me when I ran out of body wash and didn't want to go to the grocery store just to buy body wash.
