I asked the question how to access the product when original product was worn down.  The answers were to use a cosmetic sharpener.  The case appeared to be hard plastic.  I really doubted that a sharpener would work.  Original product was low so I gave it a try this morning and the sharpener worked like with any other makeup pencil!,2022-03-16 05:21:18.806048

After giving birth I developed a strange intolerance for lipsticks and lip liners. My lips would break out in fine bumps and a roughness feel like a burn. When they started to heal a scab would form like I had indeed been burned. I gave up on wearing anything at all, and just used Vaseline chap stick or vitamin E oil.  As Iâ€™ve gotten older and grown more tired of looking at my plain lips, I decided to task Amazon with finding me some lip products. I needed something to enhance my natural lip line. I was wonderfully surprised to find The Lip Bar to be Black Woman Owned! Iâ€™m a huge supporter of Black Business. I was like come on sis, I need ya! After finding my shades and testing it out,  I am happy to say that the product works for me and my lips are no longer burned. It feels great to wear lip liner again. I just may get my groove back and dare to wear a lipstick;-)) Thank you Lip Bar!",2022-03-16 05:21:18.806048
