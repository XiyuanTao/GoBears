        VINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,This is a great two in one body wash. The scent is great and very strong while using it but then fades out nicely.  I use this product with my Axe Detailer and a little goes a long way with this body wash. I have no complaints about it as it does what it's intended to do and the price is right. I will continue to keep this in my Subscribe and Save queue for as long as it is available,2022-03-16 02:24:49.385656

Have used the old version for years, but ordered this one since it specified 3 in 1.  Disappointed that I was shipped the older version.  I understand the desire to ship the oldest stock first.  But, don't send a different version.  My rating is based on that fact.",2022-03-16 02:24:49.385656
