        HALL OF FAMETOP 100 REVIEWER",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,The Wouche Away Prebiotic Total Body Cleanser and Mist comes well packaged. I tested the sensitive skin variety as well as the regular one -- both are gentle. They come in a giftable burlap pouch containing the products along with small cloths. I enjoy using this product. It does an efficient job cleansing my skin using good ingredients. They're cool and soothing and leave me feeling refreshed. I appreciate the travel size offering. It's perfect for personal hygiene while away from home and it packs easily in my travel bag.,2022-03-16 03:07:25.684778

I used it while staying at my parent's house and it is mild and gentle. Didn't bother my sensitive skin at all. Left me feeling fresh and clean. The little reusable wipes are nice to have too. This is small enough to tuck into your travel bag, purse, backpack or even jacket pocket if need be. Discreet and private.",2022-03-16 03:07:25.684778

He says it works well, much better than what is provided in the hotels.  Luckily a little does go a long way, but it lasted him two trips.  He likes it so much I will be getting more!",2022-03-16 03:07:25.684778
