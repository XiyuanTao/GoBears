Caveat Emptor-Let The Buyer Beware.  The problem is that the product contains mineral oil and petroletum oil.  Mineral oil is actually a by-product in the processing of gasoline from petroletum and molecules of the mineral oil are too large to even pass through pores of the skin and will only sit on top of your skin ""sealing in"" the germs and suffocating your skin from moisture, as well as cutting off precious oxygen and preventing toxins from escaping the skin, that can cause acne. Mineral oil is simply a cheap filler 80% of companies use to help increase their products regardless of the harmful effects to your skin and health. Petroleum is a crude oil found beneath the ground and refined to produce fuels including gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil. When it is added to beauty products (primarily as a cheap filler), it makes that product comodogenic since it coats the skin and clogs the pores and does not, therefore allow moisture in, resulting in irritation, acne, skin dryness, and dandruff (if inside a hair care product). Do you really think that consumers want to wear toxic makeup that can cause damage?  I read the label when it arrived before I wore it.  That's how I found out these two chemicals were in it.  In the end, it's about safety not a refund!  There are organic lipsticks from very good makeup companies that list their ingredients and that's who I will buy my lipstick from.  It may cost more, but you can't place a price on your health.",2022-03-16 04:30:35.563779
B00PT3QUQQ,2022,3,16,2,Good Lipstick but.....,3.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2020",Carly59,,Verified Purchase,,"I bought this lipstick a few years ago (don't remember that....LOL)  & then just again purchased again recently.. I read online that it was a good ""dupe"" for a lipstick that I love  (Urban Decay BackTalk)  so I decided to give it a try..  First of all the color isn't a color that I would call a dupe or similar to the Urban Decay lipstick, it has more of a tan overall color/look to it which you can see more on my hand..  The BackTalk lipstick is more of a pink overtone which suits me better..  It might be hard to see in the pictures but the hand swatches are very different but of course colors come out different on the lips..  NEXT....  this lipstick lasts for a while, because its a matte one (few hours for me because I don't do much eating or drinking alot)  & I always find myself reapplying lipstick through the day anyway..  NEXT...  I didn't find this lipstick very moisturizing... My lips are usually very dry & I have to use a lip balm/lip conditioner  before I put on my lipstick & that helps the lipstick be a bit more moisturizing especially if its a matte one..  I like the matte lipsticks because they stay on a bit longer, don't usually find them very moisturizing..  If you're looking for moisturizing lipsticks them go for creamier lipsticks, those are usually good..",2022-03-16 04:30:35.563779

It arrived in time for us to attend an early Halloween party. Any misgivings I had about it were quickly discarded. This particular lipstick went on easily, the color is very vibrant, and it wears very well; we didn't have to refresh lipstick until after we'd been eating and drinking for quite a bit. Even then, the lipstick was still noticeable, though slightly worn. (My daughter is very conscious of makeup, though, and wanted a refresher.) After reapplying around 6:30, we had to use a wet paper towel to get it off her lips at 9 p.m.",2022-03-16 04:30:35.563779
