B006UETSIU,2022,3,16,2,NOT a long-wearing product!,2.0 out of 5 stars,9 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2016",Nikki,,Verified Purchase,,"I have been using Revlon & Covergirl outlast and other long wearing products for years that really do last 12-24 hours and doesn't leave any marks on cups, etc.. This is NOT a long wearing product. It is really a standard lipstick that comes off on napkins, cups, etc. it doesn't stay on which is the main reason I purchased it. The texture on the lips is like other traditional lipsticks so it is heavier than the stay on glosses. The colors are a bit darker than shown which I wouldn't mind if the color stayed on.",2022-03-16 04:28:07.649030
B006UETSIU,2022,3,16,3,This is one of the best lipsticks on the market,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2022",Cathy L. Amore,,Verified Purchase,,"This particular shade was not the same color as shown. Even though I've been wearing this lipstick for years I still come back to it. It's fantastic lipstick that last. Some shades are drying like they have an exfoliator in them and it flakes on your lips. Those are really odd and to look at the colors you can't tell which are like that. You have to wear it to find which is that way. Once you find colors that are good, smooth they are really nice and long lasting. If they would correct the several sandy formulas they would have one of the best lipsticks on the market.",2022-03-16 04:28:07.649030
B006UETSIU,2022,3,16,4,Not smooth at all,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2021",SW,,Verified Purchase,,The other reviews that say the lipstick is gritty are accurate. It does not glide easily and just kinda blotches onto your lips. I topped it off with a different but similar colored lipstick which is not helpful. Not sure if it's certain batches as clearly in some reviews it looks fine. But I ordered mine in Jun'20 and it's still not a problem they have resolved.,2022-03-16 04:28:07.649030
B006UETSIU,2022,3,16,5,My favorite lipstick,5.0 out of 5 stars,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2018",Liz Bird,,Verified Purchase,,"I've spend a lot of money on lipstick over the years, so I'm shocked that good ol' drugstore Maybelline makes my favorite lipstick. The colors of this particular line are really nice, and the lipstick stays on for hours. I don't know why, but I've never been able to keep lipstick on for more than an hour - if that. When I bought long-wearing lipsticks, they'd either just come off as usual or they'd wear off, but my lips would be stained. This stuff stays on, and the color never shifts. I can't recommend this enough. It's great.",2022-03-16 04:28:07.649030
B006UETSIU,2022,3,16,6,Disappointing and misleading.,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2020",Angielpn,,Verified Purchase,,"I've been using Maybelline products for years, so I felt justified in spending more than usual for this lipstick.  I tried letting it dry, put powder on lips first, put a number of layers, etc. NOTHING worked. It DOES NOT LAST 14 HOURS.  In fact it doesn't even last ""4 hours"".  This was a total waste of money.  Shame on Maybelline for ripping customers off.",2022-03-16 04:28:07.649030

Beware of Color!",3.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2014",ItChanges,,Verified Purchase,,"I used to use Lorac's Nude moisturizing lipstick, but haven't been able to find it.  I tried four others (including an awful stick-lipstick by Lorac) before coming across this.  It's somewhat drying, so I have to put clear moisturizer over it, but the color is actually ""Nude"" and it's a nice, inexpensive lipstick.  One thing:  It has a weird cherry scent that drives me nuts, although it fades after about fifteen minutes -- not a big issue.",2022-03-16 04:28:07.649030
B006UETSIU,2022,3,16,8,Bad batch or just old shelf life!,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2022",Gadget Queen,,Verified Purchase,,"I agree w/the other reviews, either a bad batch or old shelf life. I realize this product has been discontinued from stores and the product will get old eventually even buying from Amazon. However I ordered 10 lipsticks that clump, do not go on well and cake horribly. The caps which are usually white were yellowed. There was an annoying label that ran up & down the side of the lipstick causing me to use Goo Gone to take it off leaving it tacky. This used to be my go to lipstick that would last and get compliments. Sad & apprehensive to order more.",2022-03-16 04:28:07.649030
