B00P8A4L4S,2022,3,16,1,I had to venture away from the liquid formula lipsticks for summer and this is a perfect choice!,5.0 out of 5 stars,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2018",Malinda,,Verified Purchase,,"I am and always have been a liquid lipstick kind if girl but the other day I realized I was going to have to venture out and experiment with done lighter formulas because my summer eyeshadow palettes bought so far are more matched with a lipstick not as bold and deep looking as a liquid matte.  First I bought a few from Loreal Riche color shine line and I fell in love so I wanted something along the lines of that without the hi shine finish so i can switch it up a bit throughout summer.  This lipstick is my answer.  I love the formula...feels soft and comfortable...not dry.  I ordered 2 colors to start and this is the 1st I received.  The pictures are definitely deceiving add to the color.  And being fair skinned, Iv have to be careful because it doesn't take much for a shade to look to dark out bright on me. When I opened this, I was convinced it was going to be way to dark but when I applied it, I was pleased to see that it's not as opaque as I thought and i was able to sheet it or across my lips and the end result was very flattering.  With a pop of gloss in the center...I was left wondering why it had taken me so long to discover such a pretty, comfortable lipstick.  People complain about having to reapply but you should know before you purchase a creamy lipsticklike this that it is an inevitable part of wearing t his kind if formula.  I don't mind doing it...it takes 2 seconds and my lips always look freshly applied.  Well be buying more shades",2022-03-16 05:09:04.028279
B00P8A4L4S,2022,3,16,2,A great lipstick and a great color!,5.0 out of 5 stars,12 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2015",K. Schrecker,,Verified Purchase,,"I saw this product used on Emma Stone at the Oscars and thought she looked wonderful.  I'm no Emma Stone, but I've needed an ""orange"" type lipstick for certain outfits that isn't too yellow  (I look better in cooler tones).  This is more of a coral while still having an orange tint--it is exactly what I was looking for color-wise.  I especially love the texture and low-shine of this lipstick.  There is still a little shine, but I'd call it more of a satin.  Less shine looks better on women my age (early 50's).  I would suggest going to Revlon's site to review the colors if you don't know what color to purchase, or check it out at a store if you have any questions about color.  I'm very happy with the quality and color of this lipstick.  As far as the cost--I probably could have found this much cheaper in a local store, but I'm disabled and have a hard time getting out, so I was willing to pay a bit more for the convenience of delivery.  I do think this lipstick is as high in quality as some designer/department store brands.  Well done, Revlon.",2022-03-16 05:09:04.028279

B00P8A4L4S,2022,3,16,4,I USE THIS BRAND EXCLUSIVELY AND LOVE IT VERY MUCH!  ESPECIALLY THIS AND ONE OTHER COLOR...,5.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2017",Reviewer,,Verified Purchase,,"Color Review on:  855, and 825:  I have used this color for years and recently found it unavailable at my local suppliers.  It is one of my very favorite colors.  It doesn't last all that long on me because I drink lots of water and spread my meals out in the day (so I don't eat three meals but four or five very small meals) so it is understandable why I would need to apply it frequently.  I have yet to find a lipstick that has the right balance of pigment and moisture.  This line also has a very faint fruity taste and fragrance (not floral or perfumey, yay!) and it stays put when applied.  I use a basic inexpensive lip liner.  The color is bold but the photo used in the advertisement is not accurate.  The actual item is a deep pink color which in this case, matches the photo but I'm not sure what it looks like on your computer screen.",2022-03-16 05:09:04.028279

The colors are pretty, but they rapidly disappear on your lips. Just does not last at all. Just what does the website mean by ultra high definition. There is nothing high definition about it as far as I understand the meaning ""high definition"" For the money, Ill keep it, but will not buy again.",2022-03-16 05:09:04.028279

They made the perfect lipstick.  It doesn't stink, taste bad, or feel weird on.  It smells sweetly like candy, maybe?  The color is saturated and you can be as liberal or stingy as you like with it because it spreads like melted butter.  You can put a tiny dab in the center and spread it with amazing ease to cover.....honestly I have never ever worn a lipstick anything like it.  5 stars....would give it 10 stars of 5 if you know what I mean.",2022-03-16 05:09:04.028279
