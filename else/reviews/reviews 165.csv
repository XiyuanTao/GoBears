B01MQUR2VU,2022,3,16,1,Holy grail,5.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2022",Alexis,,Verified Purchase,,I‚Äôve been using this lipstick for 5 years and I‚Äôve never had a problem with it. It goes on wet but mattifys real quick. It‚Äôs definitely long lasting. It never smears or smudges when I kiss my husband or children. Of course when you eat a little comes off but nothing major. It‚Äôs such a beautiful color.,2022-03-16 04:34:59.523239

B01MQUR2VU,2022,3,16,4,Very Disappointed!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2021",Donna,,Verified Purchase,,Bought this hoping it would last all day like some of the reviews said.  It goes on very watery and it does not last on your entire lip area.  It wears and covers half of your lip and after ab hour or so it starts to get all crumbly on your lips.  Worst liquid lipstick.  Very disapointed!!!,2022-03-16 04:34:59.523239
