B002VECIYY,2022,3,16,1,Long lasting,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2021",Sheila Shepherd,,Verified Purchase,,"I discovered this lipstick a few years ago when I tried it for the first time. I was pleased to see that it stayed on for hours! I know lots of lipsticks make that claim, but then I'm disappointed when I find out differently. When I first started buying this lipstick it was only around $3 a tube. So I guess an indication that others like it as much as I do, is the cost rising to more than double with most sellers.",2022-03-16 04:14:36.026095

Could not find the same # on the tube so I picked something close. It was so off, I would never wear it. But return was very easy. Strangely, I found the exact # I was looking for, the same color I have had a long time, and it somehow just appeared on the screen search (could not find it when looking earlier). That happens sometimes & makes no sense to me when searching on the computer.",2022-03-16 04:14:36.026095
