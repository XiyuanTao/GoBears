B00028OUIS,2022,3,16,1,Moisturizing. lasts several hours,5.0 out of 5 stars,38 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2020",MJC,,Verified Purchase,,"lipsticks is that it does not have carmine to my knowledge, which some clean/green brands have.  Eve and Soft Berry are subtle pink nudes on me.  While the Colors Raisin and Velour do look similar in the pics, they do have different subtle undertones that look different on the lips.  Raisin is a little more red-toned where Velour is more purpley red (a little similar to 100 percent pure black rose) and Clay is more brown earth toned with some lavenderpink undertones on me.  The lipstick applies moist, and the color feels like it stays on and doesn't slip off.  It lasts several hours.  I think this lipstick is a good value because of the quality ingredients and feel and will buy more colors.  I think this lipstick can hold its own against some of the more expensive clean lipsticks out there in terns of moisture, staying power and color payoff.  I would love to see more in between nudes and natural shades  from this brand.",2022-03-16 04:34:48.422743
B00028OUIS,2022,3,16,2,Fantastic lipstick; online pictures misleading,3.0 out of 5 stars,14 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2019",Brianna Hutchison,,Verified Purchase,,"I love this brand of lipstick - it’s just about the only one I use. However, be warned that when ordering from Amazon, some of the shades are very different than pictured. I ordered “walnut” thinking it would be a rich, reddish brown, but in actuality it is a bright reddish orange. Dissatisfied, considering this lipstick is inexpensive. I live in Alaska, which is the whole reason I ordered online in the first place, so it’s a big hassle to return when i do not have a UPS store where I live.",2022-03-16 04:34:48.422743
B00028OUIS,2022,3,16,3,It's a Really Good Lipstick,5.0 out of 5 stars,6 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2021",Anomaly 70,,Verified Purchase,,"Throughout many decades I've tried every lipstick out there. This is now the ONLY lipstick I use. I'm on my fourth tube (the color that works for me is Raisin) and boy, I hope they keep manufacturing this for the rest of my life! I love the fact that it doesn't have the toxins that big-name commercial lipsticks contain. And here's the thing: it lasts on me for hours, even after I eat. When, after a long time, it begins to fade, it fades in a natural and attractive-looking way. I can keep it on for half a day or more without needing to refresh it. Thank you, Gabriel Cosmetics!",2022-03-16 04:34:48.422743

Mac NW 13 foundation matches my skin tone so I'm pretty fair-skinned. It took me a long time to find a nude lipstick that worked for me! I was trying all the ""nudes"" and they washed me out and made me look like I was dead. Then I finally tried this color and realized that I need a darker, more brown lipstick in order for it to look right on me. A lot of nudes also are very pink, and on me they show up as super bright pink and not nude at all. If you have that problem, definitely try this lipstick!",2022-03-16 04:34:48.422743

With that being said, the lipstick in the shade ""Eve"" didn't even come close to the description of a deep rose. This lipstick is more of a ""Bubble Gum Pink"" and worst of all the application was just terrible! I had trouble just trying to get the color on my lips! I'm very surprised because I have several shades (Rosewood, Seashell, Pomegranate, Walnut, Raisin) of Gabriel lipstick and have never had this experience. Maybe this just was a ""lemon lipstick"". Its going back for a refund!",2022-03-16 04:34:48.422743
B00028OUIS,2022,3,16,7,So far so good for sensitive lips,4.0 out of 5 stars,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2020",Amazon Customer,,Verified Purchase,,"About 5 years ago, I began to develop an allergic reaction to lipstick.  I began to experience fine bumps and mild discomfort on my lower lip forcing me to just use products like vaseline or chapstick.  Every 6 - 8 months, I try a new brand of lip gloss and lipstick that claims to be good for sensitive lips, but by the 3rd day my lip would break out.  After taking another 6 month break, I decided to try this brand.  I am only on day 3, but I am happy to report that I am feeling no signs of irritation.  I love the color.  It comes on very rich.  It is almost matte like, so I am not finding that it is very moisterizing.  The color stays put for hours with limited eating and drinking.  I am hoping that my sensitive lips continue to behave.  I truly miss wearing lipstick and would love to try more colors.  I am feeling very hopeful about this product because all of the others that I have tried caused problems right away.",2022-03-16 04:34:48.422743
B00028OUIS,2022,3,16,8,there aren't good instructions on the Gabriel site,4.0 out of 5 stars,27 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2015",S. mitchell,,Verified Purchase,,"I read the reviews here and other sites trying to figure out how to get this primer right; there aren't good instructions on the Gabriel site.  I have never used lipstick regularly before and I wanted to learn how to get smudgeless deep color lips.  It took me about 2 weeks of trial and error to get it right, and still not 100%.  Use your finger to put a thin layer of primer on; a brush applies too much and not as evenly.  Do not rub lips together, let it dry/set for about 3 minutes.  Then apply a thin layer of lipstick and let it set.  If you see primer on your lipstick, the primer was not set and may have been too heavy a layer, so wipe off and start over.  After the first layer of lipstick is set, a few minutes, you can apply another thin layer of lipstick.  The primer does help keep it set, but you still have to reapply after a meal.",2022-03-16 04:34:48.422743
