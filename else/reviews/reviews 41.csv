You see, I don't use a loofah sponge. My wife asked if I would get these for her the next time I was on Amazon, (which in my case is about every hour). My wife has lovely soft, smooth skin and I'm sure that this aspect of her skin care regimen plays an important part. So, thanks, MainBasics, for contributing to my happiness.",2022-03-16 02:16:19.865789

The loofahs were smaller than advertised and I was given 3 different sizes & 3 different types. I thought I was going to get 3 of the same kind, just different colors. I used one and it fell apart after 2 days. I’m afraid to use the other two because I feel like they would fall apart as well. I do not recommend this at all. UPDATE: 2nd loofah fell apart after second use.",2022-03-16 02:16:19.865789

Led to a staph infection...",1.0 out of 5 stars,42 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2020",Take it or leave it ,,Verified Purchase,,"Initial review: Best ones I’ve used.  Good quality. You only need about a half teaspoon of shower gel as this “loofah” creates a lot of bubbly soap. I’ve used two different brands and types of shower and bath gel with it. Works effectively you gently exfoliate and cleanse your skin. You need to wash it and squeeze out excess soap for about 3 full minutes under the shower head or bath faucet to eliminate all soap. This process of soap removal is important. Otherwise, soap buildup left in this product can cause bacteria. Let hang to dry also is important.",2022-03-16 02:16:19.865789

At first I was like I don’t need 3 loofahs, but I realized it’ll be nice months from now to reach into my bathroom cabinet and grab one rather than having to go out of my way to buy one. I kept forgetting to get one at the store which is why I decided to go with these guys on Amazon. Love the basic color set too.",2022-03-16 02:16:19.865789
