B086P9446J,2022,3,16,1,Good Value but has some bugs,4.0 out of 5 stars,6 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2020",Adriel,,Verified Purchase,,"It works all right but sometimes it has glitches with the connection and it will reset. Installation was pretty easy to do and only took about an hour. If you don't have any experience with installing your own equipment I would go to a professional to get it done.  My only big gripe was the communication with the tech support team. I had an issue where the unit kept on disconnecting from my phone as well as I was unable to use my backup cameras. It took almost a week for them to tell me to do a very simple fix action to the unit. For future reference for anyone having this unit make sure your dip switches are on OFF position except for number 8, which should be ON. The unit itself works pretty well when it wants to. It's pretty fast and never freezes up.",2022-03-16 05:54:40.840017

Nicolosi,,Verified Purchase,,I had this professionally installed as I do not know anything about taking a car radio apart or computers. It worked to connect to CarPlay right away but I had to contact service because phone calls weren’t working. I chatted with the service rep and they helped me very quickly fix the issue. This is a great workaround for a car that does not come with CarPlay or navigation. Great product and great service!,2022-03-16 05:54:40.840017
