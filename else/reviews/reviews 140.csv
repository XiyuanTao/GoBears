B07R8TJ7WV,2022,3,16,1,Better than sephora,5.0 out of 5 stars,243 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2020",ProximaB,,Verified Purchase,,"Ok, you will do well with this product. I bought similar things in sephora and these lipsticks are the same or better. I saw some left a bad review because it doesnt come off easy. It is the hole point , you can eat and kiss with this lipstick.  When comes the time to take iff, rub some coconut oil , it will be just fine. But if you need longevity,  these are amazing. Fully satisfied.",2022-03-16 04:12:17.095472

B07R8TJ7WV,2022,3,16,3,Long wear beautiful matte finish!,5.0 out of 5 stars,103 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019",Leeane Dove,,Verified Purchase,,"Absolutely love this set.  Great colors with a matte finish.  Price is amazing so I did not have majorly high expectations, and was really pleasantly surprised.  The colors are great, the finish is pretty and the color is somewhat of a stain type so it stayed on for a really long time without smearing or wearing off like my typical lipstick.  I highly recommend this product.  Have a couple of the colors that donâ€™t match me to my mom and now she wants to buy a set too!",2022-03-16 04:12:17.095472
B07R8TJ7WV,2022,3,16,4,Great waterproof lip gloss!,5.0 out of 5 stars,94 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2019",Erica,,Verified Purchase,,I love this! It's very smooth when applying and you do feel it drying up but it does not leave a crusty feel. I tried it while drinking water and eating and it lasted pretty well. It does slightly come off but that's not til hours later like if you ate dinner after having breakfast and lunch then by dinner time you might need to reapply. And the price is great! I'm very happy and the colors are beautiful.,2022-03-16 04:12:17.095472

It definitely is not moisturizing by any means. BUT once it dries and stays! I wore it for the 2nd time yesterday and did not need to reapply after drinking or eating. I reapplied once in 6 hours of wearing but only because my lip ring had a rubbed a spot off. Great product especially for the price!!,2022-03-16 04:12:17.095472
B07R8TJ7WV,2022,3,16,6,Feels like face paint,1.0 out of 5 stars,27 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2019",Shasky,,Verified Purchase,,"Have no idea how this product gets so much star. It does matte perfectly, however it dries like face paint and feels hard, has the lip feeling stiff. Once wet it comes right off within seconds, it also chips so while drinking pieces of lipstick will be floating in your drink. I use Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink which is perfect lasts over 24hrs and bought this for more color options. I cannot wear this! By the time I leave home get coffee it need reapplying. I also do not like to have lipstick floating in my drink.",2022-03-16 04:12:17.095472

The lipstick does stay on however after I eat it always smudges off and it definitely is not good for a make-out session LOL my husband had it all over his face. That's not a terrible product maybe a little exaggerated on the long-lasting it will last all day if I go without eating and it doesn't wipe off if I touch it it's only when it seems to get wet that it'll smudge and rub off included pictures of all the colors as well as a picture of what happens after I eat with the lipstick on,2022-03-16 04:12:17.095472
