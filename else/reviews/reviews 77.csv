It smells strongly of black pepper (like the kind you cook with).  I get everything in sandalwood.  And this doesnâ€™t come close.",2022-03-16 03:04:59.272034
B08DC27GVC,2022,3,16,2,Not worth the price,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2022",Tracey Bodhaine,,Verified Purchase,,"Being older and living in a dry climate, I thought I would try to find a body wash that would moisturize, smell wonderful, and make me feel pampered. Decided after looking on line to give this one a tryâ€¦nothing special. Smells great but itâ€™s really faint, the scent is evident for what seems like a minute and then completely disappears. As far as moisturizer, this is not the product for that. Feeling like itâ€™s a special treat in the shower, nope. Not a great lather with the fact the fragrance is non existent makes this a less than average body wash. Wouldnâ€™t recommend.",2022-03-16 03:04:59.272034
