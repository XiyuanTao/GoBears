I contacted Axe headquarters and they responded ""We recommend disposing of the product as this only has a three year shelf life"". Thanks Amazon for always ripping me off because you have 0 quality control; people could likely sell anthrax on this site and get away with it.",2022-03-16 02:17:20.503771
B09B14BJ4L,2022,3,16,3,SADLY WE IN CA SEE A ***WARNING***,1.0 out of 5 stars,14 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021",MyRoses,,Verified Purchase,,I don't get it. I went to reorder this product because my bf loved it. BUT when I went to check out it has a prop 65 warning. Then I went to order a different 1 and same thing. What the warning said is that it may cause reproductive harm. Thankfully my bf isn't making babies with me but I still wonder if it can cause other harm. Overall why on earth would any body wash contain such ingredients as to cause reproductive warnings? I just think we here in America are very lax about all these products containing dangerous ingredients. I hope in the future that a group will take this matter on and insist on ingredients being used to not cause any harm in any way. I know they can make great products at good prices still that are better for us.,2022-03-16 02:17:20.503771

And the bottle lasted me well over a month. Bought it in August, had an empty bottle early October. Since AXE is thick, you don’t need a lot to create a good lather. It was hard for me to find this one in stores where I live so Amazon had it and it arrived quickly with other hygiene products I had also gotten. Typical store price, great product. The scent can be smelled on skin long after your shower. I’ve received compliments :)",2022-03-16 02:17:20.503771

My husband and I both love this scent of axe body wash. He loves it because it ""froths"" up wonderfully and spreads over you really good. A little goes a long way. It leaves him smelling amazing. I even use it because I do not mind the scent. The smell is strong, but once it is rinsed off is just a lovely touch of near cologne.",2022-03-16 02:17:20.503771
