I have been using it for about a month now and I love it (me on the right)! I bought one for my sister (Left) and she loves it too! It's really neutral on my darker skin tone, but the brown is more poppin on my sister's lighter skin tone! We love this matte lipstick and wear it often! We are both wearing the Cyndia color. Also, the lipstick does last but does not last ALL day. I do have to reapply after a few hours of drinking water and eating, but its not terrible. I love that this lipstick is vegan while my sister could care less haha! Thank you so much for this product!",2022-03-16 04:22:20.843773

Comes right off. I've been using Maybelline Long-Lasting for years but that specific brand doesn't have a gothic black, just a really dark red. So I tried this brand. Kiss? Comes off. Drink? Comes off. Eat? Oh hell yeah all of it comes off. I don't have any of these issues with Maybelline. I go all day and I just touch it up every 7 hours. In fact it's hard to take off. But yeah THIS lipstick? Sucks.üíÑüëÑü§¢ü§Æ",2022-03-16 04:22:20.843773

B01J6RORDI,2022,3,16,4,This is light and lasting!,5.0 out of 5 stars,82 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2017",A. Fahrenheim,,Verified Purchase,,"I've been on a long search for lipstick, matte, that will truly stay put. Most come off with in a bit of talking, or definitely get left on my glass or napkin. Even the ""24 hour Outlast"" and ""LipSense"" didn't hold up at work- which admittedly is hard in an operating room mask all day. Even w/out work, most had such an odd, pastey feel on my lips that eventually feathered terribly.  But this stuff- wow. It goes on and stays on like a stain. Knowing that, however, you must then apply it at first *perfectly* as you most definitely not only see where you've come out of the lines, but it stays out of the lines. But if you take your time and apply it carefully it is not only a bold matte color, feeling 'barely there' on your lips,  it really does last. I'm thrilled w/ this find so far.",2022-03-16 04:22:20.843773

It does come off some when I do a napkin test, but I still think it‚Äôs great because it is so soft.  Not heavy and sticky like some other color stay lipsticks. The color I picked was ‚ÄúEmma‚Äù, which is a dark berry red. I absolutely love it. It‚Äôs a great fall color.",2022-03-16 04:22:20.843773

It dries fast and comes off easily, I didn't even have to use make up remover, I just used a napkin, no stain either. That doesn't mean it comes off easily when you're drinking stuff or kissing people, it doesn't come off like that. It only comes off if you're actually taking it off, like applying a little pressure to rub it off, if you get what I mean.",2022-03-16 04:22:20.843773

I applied it without any liner, making sure I didn't use too much but enough to cover and let it dry. This stayed on all day long. I am trying to say this right, during lunch I didn't wipe my lips just dapped off from eating a sandwich and I could see it on my napkin, but I never had to reapply, it faded, but I could still see color, so I used a little more chapstick (kinda dried my lips) but I had it on until at 6 pm and used makeup remover to take the rest off. YEAH GOING TO BUY MORE RIGHT NOW!!!",2022-03-16 04:22:20.843773
