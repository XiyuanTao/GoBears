My only gripe is the staying power. IMO this doesn't stay any longer than a regular lipstick. Since they are of the same name ,naturally I compare them to the superstay matte ink liquid lipstick. The staying power on those is phenomenal, however this crayon doesn't compare.",2022-03-16 04:08:36.489075

I double checked the package it came in, but no cap. The tip also appears to have been used previously (the tip is not sharp, dull and uneven).",2022-03-16 04:08:36.489075
B091HYG62H,2022,3,16,4,Amazing coverage and superstay indeed!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2021",A. Bapat,,Verified Purchase,,"One of my friends introduced me to the liquid kinds about 3 years back.  I was very skeptical about the whole superstay part.. and initially it seemed to fail on me, and used to get on my teeth so much, or get on my clothes etc.. did not last as long as expected, plus the liquid one with wand used to stay sticky ALL THE TIME, which irritated me a lot.  After using is for a few weeks, i devised a method for it to stay longer.. I would put it on, and let it settle for 5-10 minute.. I would go do something else, like hair or clothes etc.  once it was settled, I would dab it out/press it in with a good kitchen towel paper.  and then apply another thin coat on top.  and that got me going .. it stayed on for HOURS.. even with food, drink etc..",2022-03-16 04:08:36.489075
B091HYG62H,2022,3,16,5,What?? So loving these lippies!,5.0 out of 5 stars,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020",TB,,Verified Purchase,,"These colors are fabulous! I have now purchased 5 different shades of these lippies & the color is super pigmented and not drying at all. Special bonus, no lip color on my teeth! I always worry that these long wearing lip formulas are going to leave my lips feeling & looking parched but somehow they managed to keep this one feeling light, lightly moist and not sticky or dry. I can barely even tell them Iâ€™m wearing anything at all! How is that even possible? Once again, I think these colors are amazing & would look good on any skin tone. I have had several compliments from friends, family & even strangers. Iâ€™ve even been asked to see the tube to confirm it isnâ€™t from a high dollar makeup line. After purchasing so many lip products & spending so much more to find a lip product that actually stays on, Iâ€™m super excited that Iâ€™ve found a drugstore brand that actually works! These are definitely a must try. I assure you they wonâ€™t disappoint!",2022-03-16 04:08:36.489075
B091HYG62H,2022,3,16,6,Great everyday lipstick!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2021",Love life,,Verified Purchase,,"Now it doesn't smudge easily I have rubbed my lips together after letting it set about 10 min. Now you have to remember if a matte feels moisturizing as this does when applying you have to let it absorb into the lips that's what it's for so you don't have a dry lip feeling. It's lightweight and does not rub off on a glass easily. With greasy food you will have to reapply just a little bit,  but that's just what grease does it's a natural makeup remover. Non greasy food stays on pretty well. Will def. Buy more and believe me when I say it's worth the money I've have bought the expensive mattes and this is just as good of quality just let fully dry.",2022-03-16 04:08:36.489075
B091HYG62H,2022,3,16,7,I will update when I wear them,3.0 out of 5 stars,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021",Amanda Brewer,,Verified Purchase,,"First of all they did not come in any kind of packaging, you get just the crayon; theyâ€™re not even wrapped in plastic so couldâ€™ve been used and Iâ€™d never know. Secondly, one of mine was missing the sharpener on the end. No it was not in the package, no it did not fall on my floor, it just wasnâ€™t there. Third, I donâ€™t know why the packaging is different on 2 of them. But anyways top to bottom I got 130 Pave the Road, 25 Stay Exceptional, and 20 Enjoy the View. Theyâ€™re beautiful and creamy but I just received them and therefore havenâ€™t worn them yet, I will update when I do.",2022-03-16 04:08:36.489075

This lipstick wasn't worth it at all.  It's more like a liner than an actual lipstick and it's hard to use for your lips because of it's application size.  The lipstick isn't smooth when putting on it and it leaves lines when dry.  It doesn't produce overall color either.  While the color itself wasn't bad, I would definitely pass and find another brand/lipstick/stain.",2022-03-16 04:08:36.489075
