B07NJQ89D5,2022,1,20,2,POOR CHEAP BLUE PUMP ON BOTTLE LEAKS BAD IN SHIPPING,1.0 out of 5 stars,56 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2019",Gerald,,Verified Purchase,,"
  The product is OK for the money, but the quality of the PUMP is terrible and you will waist allot of product because of it. When you push the Blue Top Pump to get the product out about half of it will come out around the base of the pump head that slides up and down. Amazon really needs to get with the supplier and address this issue. So for that reason and reason alone I give it one Star because it is a mess and you will waist a lot of product which does not make it a great value anymore. Second Order Replacement and it to leaked all over the place, what a mess, no more, asking for refund and not a third replacement.

  I typically buy Head and Shoulders or the Member’s Mark product. When I saw the price was around $13-$15 dollars now, I thought that was too expensive. I did some research on Amazon and ran across this product. OMG...I didn’t realize what I was missing out on. I really like the way my hair feels after washing with this and the scent is awesome. I very much recommend this product to all. I just hope they keep the price down...if so this will be my go to brand!!!

  This product is absolutely horrible. My hair doesn’t feel clean when I use it and it made my dandruff come back. My hair looks greasy after I shower even though I tried to use triple the amount I usually use to try and get my hair clean using this awful shampoo. DO NOT BUY! It doesn’t help dandruff at all and it doesn’t make your hair clean, I tried to save a few bucks buying this but it’s not worth it at all. Just go with a name brand dandruff shampoo or stick to the one that you use right now that helps. This one is just plain awful and doesn’t help at all.

  Great product especially at this price compared to other name brands. Does the same job and smells better in my opinion. Has a a pump dispenser which I think is amazing compared to traditional turning the bottle over and dumping it out.

  I purchased this as a cheaper alternative to head and shoulders.  I was really hoping it worked as well.  I have dandruff and an itchy scalp more in the colder months and have to use dandruff shampoo for relief.  This smells and looks the same as original head and shoulders but there is no tingling when washing which I like because it immediately brings relief.  It didn't help with my dandruff at all.  I don't know how well it works for everyone but it didn't work for me.

  I have lifelong sebbhorea and need zinc based shampoo. This was my least expensive option for one that does not contain added conditioner, which leaves my hair greasy and contributes to the problem. Wow, am I glad I took a chance! you will be too. I hope Amazon will continue to offer this shampoo at a reasonable price.

  Since Head and shoulder is pricey, I decide to try this Solomin brand. It does not help dandruff. It is not good as Head and Shoulder. I used this Solomon for more than month, but my dandruff still not go away."
