Ball,,Verified Purchase,,"This stuff sure works for me.  I am an old car and motorcycle enthusiast.  I do ALL my own maintenance and repairs ---big repairs sometimes.  I've used Orange cleaner with pumice.  It's been good, BUT I found this is MUCH more effective.  I was skeptical of ""dirt infused"", but no longer.  The hardest grime to clean off hands is the grime that becomes embedded after repeated hand washings.  You know...you get grimy,, clean, get grimy again, clean, repeat.  Each time the grime becomes more firmly part of your skin.  I should wear gloves more often but I just like the feel for the work when I use my bare hands.  I pay for it when it comes time to clean my hands.  THIS STUFF WORKS REGARDLESS.  I was surprised.  Anyway, you can see I'm sold on it.  Rather expensive, but you get what you pay for in this case.  I've had no problem with it being too thick to pump or clogging my sink, as a few reviews have indicated.  I will note that if you do not rinse it off very well, it leaves some kind of residue.  It feels a bit like hand lotion left on your hands, which sounds like a good thing, but I found it a bit too potent smelling if, say, you are going to work on food preparation.

This hand cleaner takes a significant amount of water to use, and, has left all four guys with dry cracked hands. In addition it takes significantly longer to wash our hands and the cleaning action pales in comparison to the Gojo we are accustomed to using, It is also significantly more expensive than the Gojo product. This product will not be bought again. I wonder why/how others have rated this product so highly. Do they work on greasy cars for a living?

Besides the body wash, I bought the bar soap and antiperspirant, all in the Extra Fresh scent. The soap is not too bad, but it melts very quickly. The antiperspirant is good but read below. I have 3 problems with this body wash. I use a large loofa in the shower. This stuff makes hardly any foam or suds, even when using a lot! I used other body washes from Nivea and Bath & Body Works that explode with suds using only a dollop. Not this stuff! Maybe a washcloth would work better, but I love my loofa.  I know that scent is very subjective. The smell is nice but a little overpowering. However, it fades pretty quickly and becomes acceptable. The biggest problem that I had with this body wash was that it doesn't really clean! Even after scrubbing with a loofa, I could still feel the residue from my Dove antiperspirant under my arms! I had to use the bar soap to get the stickiness off. I will try using some full-strength body wash under each arm first and see if that makes any difference.

It did not smell like any lavender and lemon verbina I have ever smelled. Total waste of money. A best business practice for companies is transparency regarding products, etc. Amazon should be transparent with customers and state in description the product was not made in US, etc. Customers then have the option to purchase an item which may differ in quality from those made by Unilever in US. I cannot believe the prices on some items sold on Amazon and I can't see anyone paying almost $100 for a couple of bottles of cleaning solution, etc.  which sells for a tenth of the price in stores or online from retailers.

Its formula is gentle enough to use all over, even on my sensitive skin, yet powerful enough to do what it needs to do. The fragrance is really gentle and nice. Ive been using this wash for a little over a month because my bacne was absolutely terrible. Surprisingly i have almost no bacne now. It’s 100% made a difference and my back is so much smoother i love it.",2022-03-16 03:43:55.212658

The face wash was great so I figured I would try out the body wash as well. I do get random bouts of acne on my shoulders usually during the hot summer months. I just got back from a trip to Florida and noticed I had a couple spots on my shoulders and chest and have been giving this a try. It doesn’t suds up a ton, it smells good, and you actually feel clean and stripped of oils or grime after you use it. I have noticed that it did seem to help turn some of the blackheads into whiteheads and also dried a couple of them up.",2022-03-16 03:43:55.212658

Overton,,,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"When dealing with acne products, the two big names are either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. I find salicylic acid to be more gentle and less destructive of all moisture in the skin. This wash has been around for a long time and for good reason - it does a good job of helping to get control of and calming body breakouts. It can't stop breakouts all together, but it can certainly help. The wash feels good on the skin. It leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh without being overly drying. The scent has a clean smell to it, for lack of better words. This wash is a great choice helping tame acne prone skin. I like using a cloth or body brush with the wash for increased scrubbing power.",2022-03-16 03:43:55.212658

So I decided to give this Body Clear Body Wash a try since I have had good luck with other Neutrogena products.  I have been using this body wash once a day for the past week.  So far I have not had any breakouts, so I think it's working.  But I will be certain after I have used it for a month.  This body wash contains Salicylic Acid, which is more gentle on your skin than Benzoyl Peroxide.  As long as you use this to prevent acne or treat minor cases, it works well.

I’m super sensitive to dyes as well as artificial, drying soaps. I tried both snd neither caused an issue. I used to love their Rose body wash but my local stores no longer carry it so I thought the combo would be nice to try. The Pomegranate Mango exfoliating body wash doesn’t have those annoying super thick granules so I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe it’s a natural exfoliating mixture without the tiny granules. Definitely smelled stronger than the Magnolia but not in an overpowering way at all. The other is just much more subtle so I will probably stick with the Pom Mango or alternate when I need some exfoliation. My eczema flare up has calmed down after using these soaps. I wanted to try something new bec I got tired of repeatedly using the Tea Tree (which is great for soothing tired muscles and such) and the other options just didn’t compare to the smell of these with the exception of the Rose. So I will continue buying the set. It’s a great deal to get two in one delivery. I recommend:)",2022-03-16 03:46:10.174138

It's creamy and applies like any other lipstick. The gloss in Pink Bronze is pretty. My pics don't show the metallic looking gloss too well. Not much pigment so it's good for a little shine alone or over matte lip colors. It wears off fast even when I don't eat, drink, or talk. The mascara is pretty good for an everyday one.

I find my hair and skin take to it better and doesn't at all trigger any acne in fact since I have so many skin allergies to face wash products and soap products from other companies I have resorted to washing my face with the extra strength version and my face has been taking well to the extra strength version, with no acne, no rashes and no enlarging of pores from it. Whether its correct or not I finally found something that I can also wash my face with that won't cause me any emergence of skin rashes nor does it seem to cause any acne and I have been using it for months. This version that is not extra strength I also use at times on my face too and I do find that occassionally it might cause a pimple or two and very occasionally some slight redness that usually clears up quickly. Now for the part that most people are interested in I have brunette and fine not thin/ thinning hair and both regular and extra strength versions even without the conditioner leave your hair extra silky smooth more manageable for my hair texture and fine hair type and bring out my natural colors and tones that are sometimes opaqued by cheap or heavily moisturizing shampoos. Both shampoos do give your hair aome good balanced volume but for all that I stated the shine the extra tones and more clearer lights/ highlights on my hair volume, and maintaining the health and luster I still recommend the extra strength version. Both are good but the extra strengrh version in my case just goes the extra mile and takes the cake in my opinion and experience. I still give this product 5/ 5 stars. I still reccomend to add the extra strength argan oil conditioner it'll do even more wonders for you and leave an even more beautiful luster that brings out/ highlights your natural highlights. 😉",2022-03-16 01:18:18.981901

The color is beautiful and it does last. However the packaging is extremely wasteful. This product could be delivered in a small bubble envelope, rather than a box that is gigantic in comparison to the size of the product. Inside, there is plastic insulation material that is also excessive. I appreciate the ease and convenience of ordering by mail, but feel bad about the unnecessary and excessive packaging and the lack of concern about wastefulness.",2022-03-16 04:13:56.633777

This does not take away from the quality of it though because the formula is very smooth and goes on well (I had chapstick under all of them which is recommended). It was a little hard for me using a wand because my hand is not as steady so I prefer actual lipstick. The nicest looking picture is #3 Jinx (my favorite of the bunch), the next is #14 Berry Me, and lastly #13 Fwtish. The only issue I had was with #4 since it went on a little patchy and you can tell in the photo. I did not wear these all day, but I have a feeling they will last because they're pretty tough to get off. Be prepared to have some coconut oil or some other oil based makeup remover because that's what works best/fastest. As for the matted aspect they all dried very nicely (see #13, they all ended like that but the other 2 I took a little premature so it looks wet).

The lipstick itself has beautiful carving on it. It turned out to be a soft warm red color (not orangey) very similar to what was super popular in the 90's.  Velvety smooth feel, matte but not dry, and no weird smell or taste that I could tell.  It is a regular lipstick, and does wear off after time/ eating/ drinking, but leaves a subtle stain.  I absolutely love the artwork and it looks great/ expensive on my vanity.  Planning on getting more colors.",2022-03-16 04:20:31.146843

I've been trying out so many of them since wearing a mask.  Most of them are awful-very drying and/or cakey, wear off too soon, all sort of problems.  This one is very nice.  I don't find it too drying, I won't go as far as to say that is not drying at all, it is slightly so, but not bad.  It wears very, very well, and I don't get a lot of caking on the inner lip with it.  It wears a long time, and I get very little to none wearing off on my mask.  I bought 006, Eyes on You, which is a nice medium neutral brown-but-not-too-brown, it has enough of a pink or some undertone to it to keep it from being brown.  And I have 009, Speak Up, which is a medium neutral pinky mauve, not Barbie or bubblegum pink by any means, just a neutral pink leaning warmer.  Both are very easy to wear shades that could be called Neutral shades to wear easily with most things.  I am sold on this formula, they did well with this.",2022-03-16 04:21:45.681878

Fatal apple is exactly like a clear red that reads as a sheer, clear red-pink (DUPE FOR GLOSSIER 'RED'). Blissed out is a perfect sheer warm, clear-pink with gorgeous shimmers that is not at all over the top (DUPE FOR FENTY 'FU$$Y'), and it will definitely work on many skin tones because it doesn't have any opaque color. It is like a clear pink gel with tiny shimmers. You can only see the shimmers if you examine your lips up close with a mirror.

The applicator is nice and point so you can easily apply it on your lips. I think it mostly looks like a clear lip gloss with a little tinted into it so I wouldn't use it alone but it's nice to be used as a last layer on top of your lipstick so it adds a little shine into it. The quality is nice and it doesn't make my lips sticky and it's very light weight on lips.

MANY promise this ... w/ 'smudge proof' or 'transfer proof' or w/ names like lip tattoo. However, I have yet to find that one that truly holds up to drinking, eating, and just generally going thru out your day w/ out having to reapply nor worry about looking ridiculous as part of it wears off (like the middle).  With this product, I even asked the community about long staying power w/ answers and verification it stays!  My experience is a resounding NO. It does the absolute usual- it does stay on possibly longer IF you don't eat drink normally. By normally I mean- after commute to work, the styrofoam coffee cup had lip prints on it. After eating lunch ( a Lean Cuisine pasta) I had to totally reapply as all that was left was bits in the middle of my lips. Out to dinner w/ friends, it, sure enough, wore off sipping wine :(.  Wiping mouth? Yup- appeared on the napkin. Sigh....search continues.The 'nude' color was easy to apply and did have a pleasant, almost slightly mint? flavor, but to me looked a little pink for a natural look.  Overall, yet another product that is nice, but certainly does NOT deliver that long lasting color as promised unless, hmmmm...you do little talking, eating or drinking and don't use a napkin.

I originally received a sample size of this in my monthly Ipsy subscription.  I found love with her instantly and ordered a full-size product.  I don't only love the beautiful nude shade but I love the formula itself. It does have a matte finish but doesn't dry out your lips and leave them dehydrated.

This is definitely a shampoo you will need to use with a conditioner as it will leave your hair feeling dry and staticky afterward.  The thing that bothered me the most about this shampoo was the scent - it simply didn't smell good.  The shampoo had a distinctive woody perfume scent to it.  It actually reminded me of those old medicinal Chinese soaps that my grandparents had decades ago - while it was nostalgic, it wasn't in a pleasant way.

Caveat Emptor-Let The Buyer Beware.  The problem is that the product contains mineral oil and petroletum oil.  Mineral oil is actually a by-product in the processing of gasoline from petroletum and molecules of the mineral oil are too large to even pass through pores of the skin and will only sit on top of your skin ""sealing in"" the germs and suffocating your skin from moisture, as well as cutting off precious oxygen and preventing toxins from escaping the skin, that can cause acne. Mineral oil is simply a cheap filler 80% of companies use to help increase their products regardless of the harmful effects to your skin and health. Petroleum is a crude oil found beneath the ground and refined to produce fuels including gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil. When it is added to beauty products (primarily as a cheap filler), it makes that product comodogenic since it coats the skin and clogs the pores and does not, therefore allow moisture in, resulting in irritation, acne, skin dryness, and dandruff (if inside a hair care product). Do you really think that consumers want to wear toxic makeup that can cause damage?  I read the label when it arrived before I wore it.  That's how I found out these two chemicals were in it.  In the end, it's about safety not a refund!  There are organic lipsticks from very good makeup companies that list their ingredients and that's who I will buy my lipstick from.

It might be hard to see in the pictures but the hand swatches are very different but of course colors come out different on the lips..

NEXT...  I didn't find this lipstick very moisturizing... My lips are usually very dry & I have to use a lip balm/lip conditioner  before I put on my lipstick & that helps the lipstick be a bit more moisturizing especially if its a matte one..

Eve and Soft Berry are subtle pink nudes on me.  While the Colors Raisin and Velour do look similar in the pics, they do have different subtle undertones that look different on the lips.  Raisin is a little more red-toned where Velour is more purpley red (a little similar to 100 percent pure black rose) and Clay is more brown earth toned with some lavenderpink undertones on me.  The lipstick applies moist, and the color feels like it stays on and doesn't slip off.  It lasts several hours.  I think this lipstick is a good value because of the quality ingredients and feel and will buy more colors.  I think this lipstick can hold its own against some of the more expensive clean lipsticks out there in terns of moisture, staying power and color payoff.  I would love to see more in between nudes and natural shades  from this brand.",2022-03-16 04:34:48.422743

After taking another 6 month break, I decided to try this brand.  I am only on day 3, but I am happy to report that I am feeling no signs of irritation.  I love the color.  It comes on very rich.  It is almost matte like, so I am not finding that it is very moisterizing.  The color stays put for hours with limited eating and drinking.  I am hoping that my sensitive lips continue to behave.

I have never used lipstick regularly before and I wanted to learn how to get smudgeless deep color lips.  It took me about 2 weeks of trial and error to get it right, and still not 100%.  Use your finger to put a thin layer of primer on; a brush applies too much and not as evenly.  Do not rub lips together, let it dry/set for about 3 minutes.  Then apply a thin layer of lipstick and let it set.  If you see primer on your lipstick, the primer was not set and may have been too heavy a layer, so wipe off and start over.  After the first layer of lipstick is set, a few minutes, you can apply another thin layer of lipstick.  The primer does help keep it set, but you still have to reapply after a meal.",2022-03-16 04:34:48.422743

The only thing I don’t like about Loreal lipsticks is the perfume they insist on including in their formula.  I’ve actually avoided Loreal lipstick for a very long time but this limited edition X Balmain shade was just too tempting to pass on.  This is a unique shade that is a combo of gray/violet and brown.  But it’s not a really really cool toned brown and it’s not gray either.  It has just enough purple to be super flattering on my cool toned skin.  It wears “pretty” well, not the best and not the worst.  I wish it was a truly matte formula since those have a much longer wear time, no matter the brand.  I wish someone (smart) on the Loreal lipstick team would make a proposal to just take out the perfume.  No one WANTS perfume in their lipsticks.

Not only is it the perfect orangey red, it also is extremely lightweight and feels like I’m not wearing any lip product. The applicator is the perfect length so that I’m not struggling to follow my lip line like some of the shorter applicators are, and the tube feels high end. My only complaint is that even though it doesn’t need to “dry down”, it also still transfers a lot, nothing some powder can’t help, but definitely not a great feature.",2022-03-16 05:03:22.978601

First I bought a few from Loreal Riche color shine line and I fell in love so I wanted something along the lines of that without the hi shine finish so i can switch it up a bit throughout summer.  This lipstick is my answer.  I love the formula...feels soft and comfortable...not dry.  I ordered 2 colors to start and this is the 1st I received.  The pictures are definitely deceiving add to the color.  And being fair skinned, Iv have to be careful because it doesn't take much for a shade to look to dark out bright on me. When I opened this, I was convinced it was going to be way to dark but when I applied it, I was pleased to see that it's not as opaque as I thought and i was able to sheet it or across my lips and the end result was very flattering.  With a pop of gloss in the center...I was left wondering why it had taken me so long to discover such a pretty, comfortable lipstick.

This is more of a coral while still having an orange tint--it is exactly what I was looking for color-wise.  I especially love the texture and low-shine of this lipstick.  There is still a little shine, but I'd call it more of a satin.  Less shine looks better on women my age (early 50's).  I would suggest going to Revlon's site to review the colors if you don't know what color to purchase, or check it out at a store if you have any questions about color.  I'm very happy with the quality and color of this lipstick.  As far as the cost--I probably could have found this much cheaper in a local store, but I'm disabled and have a hard time getting out, so I was willing to pay a bit more for the convenience of delivery.

You can put a tiny dab in the center and spread it with amazing ease to cover.....honestly I have never ever worn a lipstick anything like it.  5 stars....would give it 10 stars of 5 if you know what I mean.",2022-03-16 05:09:04.028279

That's because the one drawback of this product is that it is sensitive to heat and quite delicate, so you would not want to jostle it around in a purse. It is exceptionally moist and luscious.  The color L56 ""Rosy Pearl"" is the perfect color for me.  I have a fair to medium complexion and I generally avoid bright or dark colors.

        TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,I have been using the Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening shampoo and conditioner for years now.  My hair stylist first recommended it and it has worked really well on my fine and thin men's hair.  I think some get this thinking it is going to provide fuller and thicker hair that remains and does not go away.  Meaning it will over time provide permanently thicker hair.  That just is not possible.  What this does do with consistent use is after I wash with the shampoo and then use the conditioner is provide fuller and softer hair after each wash.  The fullness is very refreshing and natural.  This shampoo smells very nice and lathers up very easily.  With other shampoos I would feel build-up over time but not with this.  I also appreciate the savings buying it in large volume like here.  But what I do not appreciate it that even when purchased from Amazon themselves as I made sure to do this time the large bottle arrived with some of the shampoo leaking out the top.  It was all over the bottle and a pain to wash off but overall a minimal amount though no amount should be the correct amount.  But the shampoo itself will indeed add volume in a natural way to fine and thinning hair.,2022-03-16 00:11:07.921652

One day my stylist used the Paul Mitchell special shampoo and conditioner on me at the salon and I found myself totally in love with the smell and the way the it made my scalp tingle... And once my hair was dried and styled, I was excited to see some oomph despite the stylist not using any other volumizing products. When I asked her about it I was expecting her to tell me that it was one of the usual high end products that are normally used at salons- you know, the ones that cost like $50 a bottle- but was thrilled to learn how inexpensive they are despite their good quality. Needless to say, I ended up leaving the salon with a couple of bottles and it's been my standard shampoo/conditioner ever since. I have tried other products over the years, such as specialty shampoos that promise to improve strength, growth, and volume, but I always find myself going back to this. I really do feel that my hair is healthier and grows more quickly because of it. I also love this brand because there are several different types and scents To choose from (not sure if they are all technically part of the ""special"" line, but they do come in the same little green bottles, unlike the other Paul Mitchell products) and I've enjoyed playing around with different combinations. Currently my favorite combo is the lemon sage shampoo with the lavender mint conditioner (although I do still love the tea tree shampoo as well). I've been using these products for about 5 years now and I plan to continue using them so long as they stay available and affordable. And I absolutely recommend them to anyone with fine, flat hair like mine!",2022-03-16 00:11:07.921652

Since it is so thick it usually weighs down and the top of my hair on my head just flattened out, but this shampoo has really been helping with that.

This one I’m reviewing (green bottle) is more drying.  So I switch back and forth to keep from drying my hair out too much with the green, or weighing it down too much with the white.

Over the last few years, it has begun to thin gradually. Nothing crazy, but over time its lost some of its volume. Not to a point that a nice wash with a good shampoo wouldn't be able to hide any noticeable lack of coverage. I've used Organix (OGX) biotin shampoo, Avalon Organics biotin etc. and was happy with both. Nothing but typical couple loose hairs while shampooing or a few loose hairs when brushing afterwards. I was running low and decided to give this biotin a try seeing it had added claims such as DHT blocking properties.  I cannot regret that decision more. After a couple weeks of using this product my hair began falling out in clumps and my scalp became extremely itchy and flaky. Its typical for anyone to lose up to 100 hairs a day but this lead to over 100 per wash and every brush. I'd brush in the afternoon to check if it was still happening when dry and I'd lose even more. All I had to do was run a flat hand down my head and I'd be picking up 50 or more hairs out of the sink. I stopped immediately after realizing it had to be the shampoo. After a couple weeks of stopping with the shampoo the constant extreme itching has stopped and the flakes have lessened significantly but the hair fall is still more than I've ever experienced at any other time in my life.

Even with this, I felt a heavy residue after thoroughly rinsing, and my hair was greasy by the next day. Some might like the scent of the product, but I found the heavy vanilla like smell to be too heavy and rather noxious. Because of how much product I had to use, I’m ultimately not saving any money from more expensive products that I use significantly less of. I’m not even going to bother using this product again. Maybe I’ll use it up on my dogs or just dump it. Ultimately, this product does not give extra volume. It leaves a heavy residue and makes your hair greasy much sooner than better products.",2022-03-16 00:12:08.123432

I like the scent as well... it's hard to describe but I prefer just a clean scent (NO FLORAL), this is a little sweet (but not sickeningly).

In comparing the Amazon purchase with the Ulta purchase the fragrance was different.  As soon as I started using the new product the itching stopped.  I had to throw away the Amazon product - which pained me given how pricey Pureology is.  I find it unacceptable that Amazon doesn’t require legitimate products.  Consumers are getting swindled.

So I finally switched to a natural shampoo and conditioner (which also works really well, has nice scent, and leaves hair soft). And after 1 short week, my hair loss has reduced to normal amounts.

I bought this product along with the corresponding conditioner upon recommendation from my hairstylist, and at first I thought it was a miracle, because it made my hair so soft and sleek. I was so excited, and spent $60 bucks on more of it after I used my first order. However- around the 6 month mark, I noticed my scalp was flaking more than usual. I chalked it up to winter weather, and ignored it - until I started noticing scabby patches appearing under my hair. I could not understand what was causing it, and tried discontinuing leave in conditioners, and changing pillowcases and diet- but nothing worked. The final straw was when my follicles started detaching: hair would drift down from my head in the middle of the day and I would see it on my shirts or in my car. It was awful- and then when I was reordering this shampoo, I noticed one of the one star reviews ALSO mentioned hair loss and dry scalp. I stopped using it and my scalp healed by the next week, and my hair loss has stopped over the last month. I switched to Garnier triple nutrition and that works way better with no irritation, and costs $7 at Target. So I would not recommend this- I spent $120 prolonging my hair recovery journey.",2022-03-16 00:12:53.051467

I have found the conditioner isn't as moisturizing as it claims to be if your hair is processed or overly processed from lightening or dyeing. I definitely recommend using this in lieu of a deep conditioning treatment.

I never had scalp itch with the 1st bottle now my scalp itches constantly , way to go you saved some money,but you lost at least 1 customer in me.  It doesn't smell,feel or preform the same even my shoulders and back itch after the suds run over them after rinsing.  Do you know how long it took me to find a shampoo that worked this great.

I had an old one to compare it to. Sure enough sodium coco sulfate and other ingredients were added. I have really made an effort to remove sulfates from my hair care products, so I was really disappointed to see sulfates covertly added to my shampoo.

I bought it in hopes of changing the outermost layer from a light blonde back to silver which hasn't happened. I don't know why some of my hair turned blonde--regular shampoo, leave-in hair products to keep my very thick unruly hair tame, or too much sun except I always wear a hat? It used to be very dark chestnut brown in my youth (never blonde). I never died my hair, it started changing to salt & pepper in my early 30s, now more salt than pepper in my early 60s. Strangers, even hair dressers, told me how beautiful my hair color was, I could trust them over family/friends :-)  Six yrs ago my hairdresser helped me grow it out from a very short style and suggested shampoo for silver hair which I never tried until this. I've been thinking if it was still short, cut regularly, this lavender tinting wouldn't have happened, but just today I noticed an attractive woman with almost white short hair and could see a slight tint of lavender to it! I asked my husband if I was imagining it, he said no, he saw it too. From what others have reviewed this doesn't happen to everyone but it can happen! I've now tossed this shampoo & conditioner and have bought a shampoo for blonde hair promising to make it two shades lighter in hopes it might remove the lavender and the blonde from my hair. I just hope like one reviewer mentioned that it doesn't turn green! I may have to have it cut very short again and start over. Of course these days any color, every color, seems to be in :-) It's amazing that young women are dying their hair to look grey which usually has a lavender or blue tint to it.",2022-03-16 00:15:42.748526

About two years ago I noticed that my hair was thinning badly. I’m going to be 58 next month and I have left  what used to constitute One pigtail that’s now a single ponytail.  . I had the classic male pattern thinning above my temples and with my bangs. I was completely freaking out as my hair is kind of my signature feature. It’s always been wavy and fine but pretty. I also let my silver grow out about four years ago and the lack of processing has made my hair healthy,  shiny and soft. At the end of 2018 I embarked on this research project about how to re-grow my hair and keep what I have from hair care products, the way that I treat my hair,  and nutrition. They said not to keep your hair tightly wrapped up and to let it flow, that washing your hair every other day was better because it removes buildup on the scalp, so I dumped the Pantene and tried the biotin shampoo starting two years ago. At the same time I start Taking the 5000 mg of biotin pills for hair and nails from natures bounty that I got at Costco. And at the beginning of 2019 I research which vitamins and foods to eat which include anything high in vitamin A like red and yellow bell peppers, red cabbage, spinach, Sweet potatoes, Butternut squash and cauliflower… along with almonds sunflower seeds salmon eggs and Greek yogurt.  I bough this Nizoral In April 2019. As of today I have an entire undercoat of fine new hair but it’s only about 4 inches which leads me to believe that the biotin shampoo really didn’t affect things all that much. Four Inches of hair growth is about 8 months. So I went back on to Amazon to see you when I first bought this  dandruff shampoo and lo and behold it was in April which is eight months today - January 1, 2021. I do believe that nutrition is key along with stress management and sleep course. But I find it really interesting that I’m able to trace the number of inches to when I bought this shampoo.  I don’t know if it’s 100% direct correlation but I can testify that is working for me in the hair growth department. I also found a different hair growth vitamin that I’m going to start using next week.  It’s called Hair La Vie.  Last observation. I did use Nioxin 3  for a number of years and I don’t think it worked as well as the shampoo coupled with the nutrition. Because I still had a lot of hair thinning of the temples which is now filling in considerably. And also Nioxin dries your hair out badly. I like alternating between the biotin shampoo and this dandruff shampoo because the Biotin Shampoo is less drying than Nizoral.  The key is to get it worked up into your scalp really well and just let it sit there for a while so you have to like use it less often. I hope this helps you I know How agonizing it is to lose your hair especially when you’re a woman. Good luck",2022-03-16 00:16:03.426850

I have no more flakes on my dark shirts, and the itching has totally gone away. I still have a couple of patches I’m still working on, but wow, what a difference. Some here have said the smell is pleasant, but I wouldn’t say pleasant, maybe earthy, kind of like wet potting soil. Although this has calmed my scalp, my hair ends are very frizzy now, worse than usual, so I just use an intense conditioner now. My hair is 99% white and gets dry and frizzy naturally any way.

You MUST use conditioner on the tips of your hair every time after using this shampoo, because it does leave your hair feeling very dry. I'm also not a big fan of the smell, but it's not bad, just not something I would ever buy or wear for the scent alone. Luckily, my conditioner and other hair product take care of that.

When dealing with that company was done with, my hair was not thinning out as much and i wanted to try and get new hair growing in and work in decreasing hair falling out. I tried the wow acv and I noticed more hair was coming out than regular shampoo. I read it was not really for helping hair to grow back so I stopped. However, my oldest, who had incredible thick hair, used it because she loved the smell of it. She stopped using it after a month, but never said why until recently. Will get to that in a bit.

I only wanted to stimulate the hair growth where it was showing thinness in some areas. I used the wow coconut the first time. 3-4 times the hair came out than with regular shampoo. I used regular shampoo the next time. the usual 5-15 strands of hair would come out. I would hten use the coconut. 3-4 times the hair comes out than with regular shampoo. I emailed wow and they said not to use any other shampoo and to only use theirs to be effective. I then washed my hair with wow coconut and 3-4 times the hair came out than with regular shampoo. didn't wash it for 2 days. used coconut wow shampoo again, 3-4 times the hair came out. waited another two days before washing my hair again. I was nervous to use it again, but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. washed it and sure enough. 3-4 times the hair loss from regular shampoo. I know everyone loses on average 100 strands of hair a day, but this was insane. I then decided I was done and I needed to find the shampoo that did work for stimulating hair growth and did work (the only reason I stopped that one was because the peppermint was so strong it made me lightheaded, but I would rather wash my hair in the kitchen sink and endure the strong peppermint and have a product that works then lose hair with wow). I had asked my oldest who used the wow acv if she still uses it. she said no. I asked her why because I was curious if it was causing her beautiful think hair to thin out and it thinned out a lot. she flat out said she stopped using it because of all the hair that was falling out when she used it. She went from having to have her hair thinned out every 2-3 months with a pile that looked like a small bunny to having thin hair. This only happened when she used the wow. She said when she uses anything but wow, she has no problems with hair falling out. I don't know why the wow coconut and acv shampoos made our hair fall out, I was really having hopes with all the reviews, but there is nothing wrong with either of us for our hair to be falling out like this. Again, it only falls out 3-4 more when we use the wow coconut and acv. If we use suave, tressemme, herbal essence, we do not have an issue at all. We have the normal amount fall out that we have our entire lives that is common for everyone. I will be seeing if I can return it since it is in the time frame. I want to keep my hair. Not have it thin out 3-4 times faster than what it normally would have.",2022-03-16 00:16:36.198883

        TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,I have been using the Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening shampoo and conditioner for years now.  My hair stylist first recommended it and it has worked really well on my fine and thin men's hair.  I think some get this thinking it is going to provide fuller and thicker hair that remains and does not go away.  Meaning it will over time provide permanently thicker hair.  That just is not possible.  What this does do with consistent use is after I wash with the shampoo and then use the conditioner is provide fuller and softer hair after each wash.  The fullness is very refreshing and natural.  This shampoo smells very nice and lathers up very easily.  With other shampoos I would feel build-up over time but not with this.  I also appreciate the savings buying it in large volume like here.  But what I do not appreciate it that even when purchased from Amazon themselves as I made sure to do this time the large bottle arrived with some of the shampoo leaking out the top.  It was all over the bottle and a pain to wash off but overall a minimal amount though no amount should be the correct amount.  But the shampoo itself will indeed add volume in a natural way to fine and thinning hair.,2022-03-16 00:16:49.933870

One day my stylist used the Paul Mitchell special shampoo and conditioner on me at the salon and I found myself totally in love with the smell and the way the it made my scalp tingle... And once my hair was dried and styled, I was excited to see some oomph despite the stylist not using any other volumizing products. When I asked her about it I was expecting her to tell me that it was one of the usual high end products that are normally used at salons- you know, the ones that cost like $50 a bottle- but was thrilled to learn how inexpensive they are despite their good quality. Needless to say, I ended up leaving the salon with a couple of bottles and it's been my standard shampoo/conditioner ever since. I have tried other products over the years, such as specialty shampoos that promise to improve strength, growth, and volume, but I always find myself going back to this. I really do feel that my hair is healthier and grows more quickly because of it. I also love this brand because there are several different types and scents To choose from (not sure if they are all technically part of the ""special"" line, but they do come in the same little green bottles, unlike the other Paul Mitchell products) and I've enjoyed playing around with different combinations. Currently my favorite combo is the lemon sage shampoo with the lavender mint conditioner (although I do still love the tea tree shampoo as well). I've been using these products for about 5 years now and I plan to continue using them so long as they stay available and affordable.

I realize from using hair dye in the past that it's the amount of time that is on your head that matters the most especially on the coarse hairs on the sides. The directions state only use it for a minute or two, you're not going to get any effect from it in any great way with such little time. From day one, after the allergy test, I started using it on my entire head for at least 10 minutes. Since we're in quarantine I have all the time in the world so I did this three times each day. My hair to start with was basically 60% Gray, fully noticeable. At the end of day three using it three times a day 10 minutes each time the top of my head which is longer was basically finished and looked perfect. But the sides still had very noticeable greys and I have my sides cut very short. I remember my barber would always leave the hair dye on much longer than recommended. I decided to see what would happen if I started to use it only on my sides for 20 minutes at a time. Bingo after two days three times per day I have even color throughout. Now I can use the maintenance dosage when needed which would probably only be once every two or three days. I realize not everyone has the time to do this three times per day but at least leave it on longer for about 20 to 30 minutes in the beginning..the results will come quickly and then you can get to your maintenance ASAP without having to worry about the stubborn course greys.",2022-03-16 00:19:03.541838

I have light blonde hair (bleached) with platinum highlights throughout (UBER bleached) and try to keep it on the cooler side of blonde.  After reading all kinds of reviews I decided on this shampoo.  IT. DID. NOT. DISAPPOINT!!!  After reading lots of advice I prewashed with a clarifying shampoo, rinsed, donned some gloves and latered up with this shampoo.  I left it on for 3 minutes and rinsed.  WHOA!  Immediately I was able to see a difference.  I made sure to follow up with a moisturizing hair mask as this shampoo is very drying (was warned so wasn't surprised) and after towel then light blow dry was so happy with the result!  Cool blonde with platinum, REAL platinum highlights.  Just like I came from the salon!  I plan to do this about once every three weeks (I only wash once or twice a week) to keep up the results.

I think the bad reviews are from people using it on darker hair. I read the reviews and looked at the pictures and decided to try it out. So glad I did. I have relatively light blond hair but it’s very fine and as a result my hairdresser is reluctant to use a high volume bleach for fear of doing too much damage. This shampoo has elevated my blond hair to almost platinum which is exactly what I was going for. I left it on for around 2 mins. Roots went a little lilac so next time I’ll probably just use it to brighten the ends. It’s worked so well even my hairdresser wants the name of it! If you want a platinum blonde or brighter grey you must purchase this. Read the instructions and you can’t go wrong. Best purple shampoo I’ve used, and I’ve tried A LOT.

It is very strong so my advice to you is ""less is more"". What I mean is if you are using it for the first time and don't know how long to keep it on, choose the lesser time. For example, I left the product on for 3 minutes the first time. It definitely toned down the brassiness in my hair, but it wasn't quite the silver color I was trying to achieve. I waited a few days and a couple of shampoos later, I tried again and left it on for about 6 minutes and there was quite a bit of silver tone to it. So, it really depends on what color you are trying to achieve. I am trying to stay current with the silvery blonde look that seems to be in now. I am very happy with this product and I hope more people in the US find out about it. NOTE: The picture where I’m wearing the black sweatshirt is the before shot.

So, when I found this product, I immediately purchased it with the hope that I could replace the Neutrogena shampoo.  First, the name is a little misleading.  It is indeed a shampoo, not a cream.  The scent is very light and the shampoo lathers but doesn't feel harsh.  I also used Redken All Soft Mega Mask to condition after washing. When my hair dried, it was shiny, soft, bouncy and manageable. My scalp felt moisturized as well.  I could tell the build-up was gone because the color was lighter.  In conclusion, I had much better results than Neutrogena.  If you have fragile, fine hair I would highly recommend this product.  * P.S., I used this shampoo to prepare my hair for color treatment.

Literally. Within the past month, I've spent over $100 on shampoos trying to fix an issue I've been experiencing with my hair. I have very thick, oily, and heavy hair that after about 12 hours, feels greasy (and sometimes looks it too). About a month ago I realized I wasn't able to fully wash product out of my head even when using just a little bit and washing it out for 30+ minutes. Every single day after drying my hair for over an hour, I'd find a clump of shampoo/conditioner stuck in the back of my head. I couldn't get this out no matter what treatments I did, no matter what product I used, etc. I went through multiple bottles and brands of shampoos and none of it worked. I then came across this product and bought it as my last hope. I washed with this shampoo two days in a row and my hair no longer has left over product it, it stays soft and light for over 24 hours now, and I can't say enough good things about the consistency and sent of the product itself. If you've experienced any issues like I've had above, I kid you not this shampoo is worth every dollar. If I had just bought this shampoo in the first place I would've saved myself over $100.

That always worked well for me. I decided to try the micro oil shampoo/conditioner, because I felt like my scalp was getting too dry. That was unfortunately a mistake. This caused a lot of build up of product on my scalp and my hair to be so greasy! I did make sure I rinsed aggressively to get all the product out, and I only us conditioner on my scalp once a week. That being said, the conditioner worked great for my ends. I decided I needed a scalp reset so I bought this shampoo, and it’s been a world of difference! My hair gets squeaky clean but I don’t have a dry scalp! I have noticed my ends looking a little ragged, but I also haven’t gotten my hair cut in almost a year.

One of my favorite pastimes is shaving my whole body, putting on a speedo, oiling myself up and diving down the lanes at the bowling alley while people are playing. You might ask why I do this and it’s hard for me to really pinpoint exactly. Maybe it’s the attention. Maybe it’s about how sexy I feel while lubed up in a Speedo. Maybe I like the abuse of angry, fat, stinky guys trying to hit me with their bowling balls as I glide over the lanes on my belly, feeling majestic af. Who knows…..yet I digress. Anyways, I used this shampoo as my body lube and I was not disappointed. It created optimal sliding conditions, slathered all over my hairless body. And that’s all I was really looking for but it turns out it also was fantastic for my skin! I’ve never felt my skin so moisturized. It feels smoother, silkier, dare I say younger?!

None of the shampoos will help you grow more hair but they certainly will improve your hair quality and make the most of what you have. A little goes a long way too, especially the conditioner.

After coloring and highlighting my thick, beautiful hair since the age of 17, having children, becoming older, my hair was a frizzy, brittle, product-needing, thinning mess.  I had to style my hair more and more and use more and more products to help it look nice.  I then started a new job and began working for an older woman who had the most incredible head of shiny and thick salt and pepper and silver hair.  I asked her what products she used and she said none.  She told me she washed and conditioned only.  She said the secret was to not color your hair and find a shampoo that kept your scalp healthy but didn't fry your hair.  She said, take care of your scalp so it is able to grow healthy hair, and don't abuse your hair once it has grown out.  It was such simple advice.  I stopped coloring and highlighting right then and there.  I won't lie.  It was rough at first and I felt ugly. The grow out was tough.  I did end up cutting it short once it had grown out a bit to get rid of all the processed fried hair.  I am glad I stuck with it, though.  Three years into my natural hair journey, my hair is healthy and shiny and growing like a weed.  I have light brown hair with an awesome silver streak on the top of my head.  That was another discovery, I had no idea what hair color I had.  Anyways, once my hair grew out, I wanted to invest in a shampoo that would promote a healthy scalp and nourish my hair.  This shampoo does the trick.  I no longer have dandruff and my hair is light and full of body without frizz.  And, after years of blow drying and using a straightener, I now wash my hair and let it air dry.  I have shiny, beach waves with lots of volume and no frizz.  This shampoo cleans my scalp so well but does not strip my hair.  I only have to wash my hair twice per week and it always looks good.  I have noticed that since I started using this shampoo, my scalp no longer itches and there is definitely less hair in the drain.",2022-03-16 00:21:41.178332

After I used the shampoo, I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed until I felt like my hair was reasonably clean, but it was still so greasy that I didn't even use the conditioner. My hair is wavy caucasian hair and although I like hair care to be somewhat moisturizing and not stripping, this was FAR too greasy and heavy. I matched my hair type on their website to their suggestions and ordered this for me to use and for my teen daughter with loose curly hair. I wish I could give it 5 starts, because the ingredients are much safer than most other shampoos, but I can't because it is NOT good for typical caucasian hair in my opinion. People with dry curls may like it and it likely is great for those that want a REALLY HEAVY THICK moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it was so thick that my daughter's hair looked about 3 shades darker until she rewashed it with Acure (which we've used for the past few years).",2022-03-16 00:22:01.903262

This curl shampoo enhances, like a curl cream or other styling product, and makes my wavy hair curly almost immediately- I wonder if it's the neem oil or hibiscus but the effect is darn visible! I love it because the look I get right after I shampoo and air dry my hair is natural, healthy, curly, and more tamed than other SLS products have gotten me.

My hair was brittle and seemed always dry no matter what products I would put on it. I thought that I would have had to cut my hair and start completely over. However, when my products arrived, I could not wait to give them a try. I love the smells. Very nice and not powerful. I washed my hair twice with the Nexxus Shampoo, first time just the scalp, and the second wash, the hair itself. The way that my hair reacted to this shampoo was breathtaking! My curls appeared and believe it or not, I was able to pull a comb through my thick, natural, 4C  hair!! I have never, ever been able to do this before while washing. Barely any hair was coming out in my comb! I had not even used the conditioner yet. I just had to stop and look in the mirror and talk to myself saying, ""Omg, I cannot believe this""! I have never, ever experienced a shampoo doing my hair like this before. After I completely rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I moved on to the Nexxus Conditioner. Even more amazing. It stated to leave on the hair for 3 min, but I sat under a hooded dryer for about 10min with the conditioner on my hair, under a plastic cap. Once my time was up, I rinsed away all of the conditioner. My hair was so manageable!! I was able to comb and section it to do my bantu knots and allow my hair to dry overnight. After washing my hair, it only took me about 30 min to get it  all done to dry. I have never been able to complete this process this quickly before! I am highly satisfied with these products! Even though they are  expensive products, I'm hooked and will be purchasing again. I told my mom about my experience and am ready to try it on her hair also, to see if she gets the same experience and satisfaction that I got. Thank you Nexxus for such wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them. Definitely a must try on the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner for Severely damaged hair.

I will say that if you are sensitive to perfume smells, this may be too strong for you. I enjoy the sent and the fact that my hair holds that sent beyond 24 hours. Even after using a different shampoo for a day, the smell of this one still comes through. Also, if you are prone to greasy hair, this may make it worse.

I know that’s typically not recommended but I believe this shampoo and conditioner are made to treat and repair the entire hair strand. Also, it smells amazing. The thing I would compare the smell to is the Moroccan hair treatment oils that are out there. Very pleasant and it lasts after styling which I like because I love to smell good!

It is a clear shampoo and not real thick.  It is concentrated so you don't need allot of it and it lasts for a long time.  Well worth the money I paid for it.  Also a note to the shipper, the shampoo did leak inside the bag that covered the bottle.  My suggestion is to have a tight sticky foil or cardboard paper glued to the bottle opening so it does not leak.  My bottle did leak but not to bad of a mess.  I had to clean it up, my counter and the outside of the bottle.  It didn't lose to much shampoo but that can be prevented with a sealed tab on the bottle opening.  I am not sending back the shampoo.  It may have lost maybe 2 tsp. fulls of shampoo.  So I am making a suggestion.  This is my favorite shampoo on the market.  Great Price.",2022-03-16 00:22:32.061644

So I bought into the whole “function of beauty” (among a few other brands), make your own shampoo fad and it only made it worse. So I unclogged my ears and bought this shampoo and their thickening kind as well. Let me tell you, my hair has never felt, looked or smelled better. It’s like night and day.

Let me first say I have well water, I use heat on my hair and get highlights on my long fine hair so I have some pretty extensive damage. Short of cutting it all off (not ready for that yet) I decided to give it a try after a YouTuber I follow recommended it for my healthier hair journey. I've used A LOT of salon quality shampoos in the past, never being impressed for all the money I fork out on them. My last shampoo purchase was a drugstore brand that I got because it was the most amazing smelling stuff ever and I was tired of spending money and getting the same results. (I know, blasphemy). Finally coming to grips I needed to spend the money and switch back to a better brand if I was ever going to heal my damaged hair, I took the leap. And let me tell you I'm so glad I did. First off, I didn't even mind getting rid of the drug store brand after I used this stuff. Holy heavens to Betsy, it smells amazing! I've been sniffing my hair all day! My hair feels super soft, it's shiny and frizzy split ends are softer and less noticeable. This is after ONE wash y'all. I can't wait to see what it does after 6 months of use, combined with the other changes I'm making for healthier hair. Once I've used it more, I'll leave another updated review about how long the shampoo/conditioner has lasted and how it's helped my hair.

But I couldn't possibly rinse anymore than I had already been, considering my hair was matting in the water, post lather. I've never used a shampoo bar prior to this, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I don't believe I can continue using one. It's too much of a headache just to save a bit of plastic...

The size of the bar is substaintle in comparison to many others too. However, on first use I knew it wasn't love. First it didn't seem to lather as well as some other brands I have used. So it took a lot of effort to get a good bubble going. I had noticed the insert with the bar talked about a transition period which I thought was a little weird because I hadn't experienced it with any other brand. My hair was SOOOOO dry and icky feeling. I hated it. But I stuck with it. I used this bar for a couple weeks before I finally threw it away and went back to a different brand.

Turns out, the bar just leaves some sort of coating all over each hair that's completely impossible to wash out, unless maybe you have a different soap. Ironic. The residue looks like grease, leaving me with permanantly greasy looking hair, and it makes it take over an hour to brush out my thin, curly hair without ripping all of my hair out of my scalp (especially because the hair being sticky makes it catch and pull all hairs around it into tighter knots), and it then leaves a thin, white, sticky residue all over my brush.",2022-03-16 00:28:48.090082

I have silky fine thick hair that is often just limp and fizzy. This shampoo help clean away all the junk that weighs it down and provides a bit of shiny volume without the frizz.  I don't need to use more than a nickel /quarter-sized amount to wash for my medium long hair. I do occasionally wash twice if I skipped a day to wash my hair. Definitely use a small amount of the complimenting conditioner to help smooth hair and minimize tangling. Do comb your hair before washing, I find it helps minimize tangles and snarls too. DELIVERY REVIEW: Kudos to the people for getting my shampoo to me. I wasn't suppose to get it for another month and it surprisingly arrived today!! I have been using a moisturizing shampoo that was just too much for my poor scalp because this was out-of-stock at all the local stores. Thank and Blessings to everyone working so hard to get items out to us. }}hugss{{",2022-03-16 00:36:19.878924

It is an earthy smell but in no way does it smell horrible. Words cannot express how happy I am that I gave this shampoo a try! I noticed a huge difference after using this product for a short amount of time. My hair is thicker and healthier looking than it has ever been.

Always had lots of compliments on my ""silver hair"" (silver fox, etc.). Now in my 60's I am completely gray and noticed that it ""looked"" gray and not so ""silver"" anymore. I noticed that frequently there seemed to be a yellowish hue in certain lighting. I tried vinegar rinses and a few other suggestions I found online but never really felt anything changed. I bought this product after reading reviews on every Amazon listed shampoo for gray hair. I found a huge difference in prices. I selected this product because it seemed reasonably priced and I didn't want to spend a lot of money for something I wasn't sure would work.  I ordered it and received it promptly.  First use I noticed it was VERY purple and had some concern about staining shower area but that turned out to be not a problem. Left it on for 2-3 minutes as suggested.  Dried my hair with towel and went about dressing, etc. When I went to brush my hair before leaving for the office, I noticed that my hair once again looked more ""silver"" than gray.  I actually received a couple compliments that first day about how handsome I looked and I have to think it was related to the product.  I use it a couple times a week and it has a noticeable effect on keeping my hair more silver looking than gray. It also seems to a very good quality shampoo in addition to addressing the gray back to silver issue.

Before using this shampoo my hair would start to turn yellow/brassy after a week or two of getting it done. This isn’t the case anymore after using this shampoo. It’s helped me transform my blonde hair into that icy/pastel blonde I’ve always wanted. I try to use this shampoo twice a week and leave it on for about 8 minutes. Make sure you evenly distribute the product through your hair for optimal results. Once applied brush it through! Make sure you rinse thoroughly and follow up with a conditioner. I recommend!,2022-03-16 00:42:04.596872
B01HQCGYDQ,2022,3,16,2,My mom loves this,5.0 out of 5 stars,30 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2019",KJ,,Verified Purchase,,"I am dark-haired so, alas, I cannot use purple shampoo.  My mom, however, recently decided to grow out her grey hair, and was curious to try something that might make her hair pop a little.  I had heard purple shampoo can give grey hair a cool, silvery glow, so I decided to get her some.  First, I got her the Bedhead brand one, and she said it was a nice shampoo but did nothing in terms of color-depositing, and was barely even purple-toned out of the bottle.  My platinum blonde-haired friend highly recommended Milk Shake, and I could tell it was effective judging by the silvery purple glow on her own hair.  This shampoo was a total win for my mom.  Her hair looks so silvery and awesome.  From what I gather, you can either build this up so you get a purple sheen like my friend has by leaving it on for longer, or if you want to keep things subtle and not deposit any color, you can wash it out quicker.  I can't believe how great these results are, and I'm honestly jealous that I can't have hair like that.  She's already asked for another bottle, and I really hope Amazon keeps selling this because I don't think she'll switch away from this. I'm sure I'd look terrible with blonde hair, so I'll have to settle for seeing the super groovy effects on other people.",2022-03-16 00:42:04.596872

If I could give this product 10 stars then I would! I absolutely love anything from the Milk Shake brand and love how natural their products are! I first learned of Milk Shake from my hairdresser who praised the brand and began using it in her salon. This shampoo is a rich purple shampoo that instantly eliminates any yellow or brassy tones in blondes. I find that it is darker in color than most purple shampoos (wear gloves if you are worried about finger/nail/cuticle staining) and it is more moisturizing than any other purple shampoo I’ve used. The shampoo smells wonderfully or berries and is my go to choice when my blonde needs a pick me up!

The scalp has a ph between 4.5-5.5 and the hair shaft has a ph of 3.67. Your shampoo needs to have a similar ph as your scalp. A ph higher than 5.5 with disrupts the protective lipid barrier. Your conditioner should have an even lower ph to match the hair. A shampoo with a ph of 9 is extremely alkaline and damaging. To put that into perspective permanent hair dye has a ph of 8.5-9.2.

When I use regular shampoo it still had a silky texture and waved up. So I said the magic must be in the conditioner. When conditioning, it did not make a difference. After the full lace wigs dried, the smell was horrific. It is a super strong perfume smell. When I applied the wig, I had to take it off within 20 minutes because the scent was unbearable. I tried two times, each time airing out the hair hoping that it will die down. A week later and the scent was just as strong. On the finally day, I took my trusty Dawn dish detergent, because it strips anything (praying the entire time because the wig was 300 bucks), to strip the smell. It worked and my wig is back to normal. Can you imagine if I put it on my hair? I returned it immediately. UPDATE! The wig dried and the super perfume still remained. I could smell it wet. I have put it in a netted bag and put it in washing machine with Tide oxi. If that doesn't work, I will try baking soda. What type of chemical is this? Finally....I had to throw away full lace wigs.

I go through it very fast as I shampoo everyday , so this little bottle doesn't last long . My only complaint is like the other customers have said , the pump is inferior . I had to to take the pump dispenser out of the bottle and shake it into my palm to get out the shampoo which was difficult because it it quite thick . That's a pain .

If you like the scent this just might be the stuff for you. For me, it was a little difficult to get the pump working. I think I would prefer a regular pour cap top. It doesn't lather that heavily, and yes, I know, this is not any indication of how well it works. It is just that if you grew up with very lathery shampoo this might take some getting used to, I am not fond of the scent, which feels too thick and too heavy to me. After washing my hair it felt ok, as in: not bad. After my hair had fully dried, however, and I took a brush to my head, my hair turned out to feel silky and smooth like a very expensive coat. I like that alright. But probably not well enough to put up with the packaging and the smell. Earlier this year I reviewed another strongly perfumed vanilla scented shampoo, and for what it's worth, if I were going to over look the scent I would probably go back for that one. Or just buy a different high quality shampoo that is unscented, or has a less overpowering scent.",2022-03-16 00:53:26.347963

So here’s a suggestion for you complainers, lemongrass is good for oily hair. The mint is best for dry scalp. Geez. As for bar of shampoo getting thin towards the end of its life and breaking into smaller pieces, solution is to put bits and pieces in a little mesh bag. That’s not too hard is it? Complaints about mushy soap? Well, don’t leave it in the tin with lid on it. Let it dry between use. Anything wet and sealed inside a metal tin will stay wet. Geez. Sigh. I love this product. I read the ingredients thoroughly and was not disappointed in the results. I’ve stopped coloring my hair and my grey hair can be uncontrollable with dry scalp. My hair is smoother and less frizz and healthier than it has ever been. I personally like the scent as well. It’s a nice natural scent. So others complaining about scent clearly prefers the strong perfumes of bottle shampoo, the same shampoo laden with chemicals. So if you want clean, healthier hair with herbal scent then buy it. If you want heavy, strong smell and chemically coated hair then buy something else. So simple.",2022-03-16 00:53:59.500107

I have fine hair that has always gotten oily quickly, I typically wash my hair every day or every other day because of this and it is very hard to find a natural shampoo bar that doesn’t weigh my hair down or leave a lot of residue. It’s nearly impossible to find one that doesn’t have coconut oil as one of the first ingredients which I try to avoid because it takes days and/or 4-5 washes to get coconut oil out of my hair. This bar doesn’t have any coconut oil at all which I love! My hair feels super clean and bouncy afterward, not full of static or totally flat after using it. It leaves my hair shiny and not greasy. I can go a day in between washes no problem. I got the Rosemary Mint scented one which smells really fresh and clean but is not overpowering. It lathers super nicely too.

This is definitely what caused the reaction as I am super allergic to stinging nettle (as are most people as far as I know...) so now I’m confused as to all the positive reviews on this product.

(I had reached out to the company over the summer to find out when/if a shampoo was going to be made; there was only the conditioner at the time. I’m happy to note the shampoo was available for purchase when they said it would be). The shampoo lathers very well, especially compared to other shampoo bars I’ve used. The only thing I would suggest is to be sure and read the ingredients. I purposely bought the rosemary and peppermint because I can’t use any citrus oils; that’s why I don’t buy the other scent they make.  I assumed the shampoo would be similar to the conditioner ingredients and bought two. After getting an itchy scalp I looked up the ingredients and what do you know listed is grapefruit seed extract. I’m thoroughly disappointed. Now my kids are using it and I had to find something else. Wonderful product if you’re not allergic to any ingredients!

Just for clarification, I have very thick but fine hair.  It's gotten thicker in recent years due to grey coming in.  My natural hair color is dark brown. But I have been bleaching it blonde in the last year.  So I decided to try this because I try to keep my hair a whitish silver blonde.  It's not even close to the typical blonde when you think of blonde hair, I think more of a yellowy gold color comes to mind because most natural blondes tend to have natural golden tones in their hair.  I am very pale, so gold or yellow doesn't look good on my skin tone.  I really wish it did.  So I did use it a few times to give it a chance but I had to stop using it, because right off the bat I noticed when I shampooed my hair with it, my hair which had felt fairly soft before instantly got knotty.  I don't know if there is a strong chemical in it that is meant to remove build up of  metals or minerals in your water that are known to yellow the hair. But whatever the reason I expected the conditioner to fix that.  I would have thought that the conditioner would make my hair soft and manageable again. But I was disappointed to soon find out that no, it did not. In fact it didn't seem to make any difference in the way my hair felt, which is important to me being that my hair might be thick but its very fine, so it makes it even harder to comb through without ripping and pulling half my hair out if its not soft enough after a shower. And using both of them I felt made very little difference in toning down the yellow.  For me whatever difference it did make was not worth the way it made my hair feel which was knotty and unmanageable and very dry feeling afterwards.  Many people with a different texture of hair may disagree, especially if your a natural blonde. Because if your hair is unprocessed maybe it wouldn't have the same effect.  But this was my experience.",2022-03-16 00:56:18.700081

It comes with six different colors with unusual scientific names such as:  Beakers, Vials, Flasks, Condensers, Distillation, and Test Tubes.  They arrived in a plastic bag and were each in their own little box.  The bottles inside are cute little nipple top bottles, but the top is not a squeezable dropper type.  The applicator wand inside(attached to top), is just the right size with an angled sponge tip.  I found it very easy to apply with precision.  I tested all colors on my hand, and the color Flasks on my lips.  It didn't say how long it takes to dry, so I gave it a good 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes I applied water(as it said it was ""waterproof""), and smeared it a little.  There was some bleeding of color, but after wiping off the excess that bled, there was still a substantial stain left.  I did the ""blot test"" on a tissue and only a small amount of color came off my lips.  When I tested it by drinking from a straw, there was no transfer at all of color.  I even licked my lips a few times and ate something and most of the stain remained on my lips.  I even used soap and water on the colors on my hand, and five out of the six colors remained.

I can grab a tube of lipstick and apply evenly with a refined edge in a second, whereas this liquid lipstick goes on thick in some areas and thin in others. Once I get it smoothed out evenly and it has dried, it is okay, but it's more like a stain. My dry lips are soon begging for some kind of soothing layer to keep them moisturized.

        VINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,"This is one of the few real lipstains on Amazon, it stains (and stays on) like permanent marker.  It comes with applicators, but applies and dries like permanent marker without the sticky feeling on your lips. The colors are dark and bright if you apply them like the description says.  I prefer a more natural/subtle look, so I only put one layer on the inside of the lips (as suggested), then smear it with my finger to cover the rest of the lips, and use a makeup remover to clean up the lines. I put on lip balm on top to keep my lips from drying.  This stays on all day until I remove it.  Even after eating greasy food, it barely fades. I just re-apply lip balm, and not have to worry about looking in the mirror.  The first picture is without any lipstick, the others are with the lightest application of 4 colors.  I probably won't use the 2 darkest ones.  I wish they made them in natural shades, too.",2022-03-16 05:24:43.956934

Or at least demurely announces it. The tube is seriously beautiful with a magnetic lid that literally snaps itself shut. The color was close to what I thought I saw online but it ended up looking slightly orange against my skin tone. I’m a medium light neutral skin color, primarily of Japanese and Mexican descent. The lipstick is creamy and I’d call the finish right between satin and matte. It’s not shiny by any means but it’s also not completely matte. The staying power is ok. It’s doesn’t last through any eating or drinking but it’s will stay in place if you leave it alone. The formula is creamy and smooth but slightly thin. You have to apply carefully to get it in an even layer. Just guessing by the finish, I think it’s better brush applied. I would buy this formula again. I just feel fancy and high class when I use it. I’d probably try another color in the future.",2022-03-16 05:26:52.531614

No. It's too costly, I have another lipstick from an Indie brand that is also expensive but still less than this one. And it does the same thing for me (even has the same magnetic lid).

I can hold the bottle up to the light and see approx. 25% of it leaked out of the lid during shipping.  There was no plastic/bubble packaging or tape over the lid.

Definitely need to wear it with a full face of makeup. Not a natural color. The pencil glides the color on very smoothly and it stays ok and doesn’t get on your mask or anything since it’s matte. It came with a sharpener so you can sharpen it. It’s a good and pretty sharpener with two holes the smaller one you can use for your lip liners! :) This one was $11 all together not too bad. Some other sugar shades are more pricey. Hope this review helps. I bought this because I wanted to try a dark bold color and see how that would look on me. Def stands out.,2022-03-16 05:28:28.331206

I have used Keranique only twice, but each time the result has been much less than wow. Apparently it's not a color-care shampoo (I concur with some other reviews in that it seems to drag the color down), and though it has a pleasant enough scent and lathers nicely, it has not done anything noticeable in the hair-growth and hair-thickening department. The conditioner on the other hand is plain horrible. It is waaaay too light and does not detangle the hair, AT ALL. My hair doesn't feel anywhere near smooth after working the product in, I have to use a comb and use an enormous amount to reach the desired result. Which is not reached, regardless. My stylist advised not to use any voluminizing products because they tend to leave you hair dry and brittle. Am going back to my store-bought Herbal Essences ""Color Me Happy"" combo which leave my hair feeling so smooth. Conclusion: This Keranique purchase was equal to throwing 40 bucks into the garbage.

Module was about $60 for steering wheel controls which is annoying that this stereo did not come with it but advertises it has steering wheel controls and that is not true that you have to buy seperate. The wiring was not as easy either took several hours i got the largest stereo frame kit and had to sand it down to fit the stereo it is very large long ways and the front facing as well. Took all day to install and make sure i had all to install.

Really don't understand where this item gets such a high rating, but as we have come to expect on Amazon the manufacturers are manipulating the ratings with giveaways, etc. The cords are absolutely not long enough on all fronts. The power cable is not long enough to reach from the front seat cigarette lighter. The connection cables for each monitor are also not long enough to reach from seat to seat in your average minivan. This is my biggest pet peeve with the manufacturers of these is they need to include at least another three feet of cable on all of the connecting cables. The plastic mounting brackets are also worthless on your average minivan as the screws aren't long enough to screw into the headrest posts. They do have straps so we tried those, they just slip right off the headrest into a position that isn't viewable for the average child. Part of the reason we bought these is because of the plastic mounts and not the fabric straps as we've been down that road before. The screens are nice, that is one positive we can say about them.

Installation was pretty easy to do and only took about an hour. If you don't have any experience with installing your own equipment I would go to a professional to get it done.  My only big gripe was the communication with the tech support team. I had an issue where the unit kept on disconnecting from my phone as well as I was unable to use my backup cameras. It took almost a week for them to tell me to do a very simple fix action to the unit. For future reference for anyone having this unit make sure your dip switches are on OFF position except for number 8, which should be ON. The unit itself works pretty well when it wants to.

Great media receiver for the price. A few things worthy of mentioning to write a helpful review. For my car (Toyota Prius), the unit appears to match up with standard double DIN size, however, the framing around the factory radio exceeds the standard size, resulting in a big gap. It's about an inch and  half difference or 3/4 in on each side. This makes it impossible regardless of the mounting kit used to eliminate the gap because some of the factory framing is attached to the original radio. In my case, unless I bought the $100 harness, I would lose the temperature and steering wheel controls, so I bought Toyota harnesses that match up to the new one and attached the remaining factory harness back into the factory radio. Basically, as a cheap solution, I have to leave the unusable factory radio mounted and this new one underneath it.

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I was really excited to use this device seeing that it gives you Android 9 in your car and all you have to do is own a vehicle with wired CarPlay to use it! The setup was really easy just plug it into your CarPlay USB, connect to it via Bluetooth, and you’re all set. You don’t need a 2018+ car, as I did it with a 2017 and it worked fine! Onto the device features, it very much is android 9 down to the core with a skin on top. Most apps will run pretty smoothly like YouTube and Hulu for instance but I’ve noticed that Google Maps is incredibly slow and I usually have to force close it to the point where I ended up going back to CarPlay in general as it was just taking too long to load map data. There’s split screen which is super useful though if you want to rock Google chrome and Netflix or YouTube. The browsers run fine, not too slow and not too quick. I think for the asking price the devices should be able to get a cpu or ram buff to handle more demanding tasks like maps as it really shouldn’t take that long but in general this device is pretty solid for everything else! It’s cool to have a fully functional version of android in your car!",2022-03-16 06:12:20.435232

The pictures and videos in this review were downloaded from the app to my phone. It was easy to do.  The video quality is pretty clear. It records both inside and outside at the same time. The sound quality is also pretty good, however I removed it from the video for privacy reasons. I saw some cams that are way more expensive but I have also saw that are cheaper. I don't know how good those cheap ones really are though. The only negative comment I have is that it doesn't come with the memory card.

I can't say for sure whether it works with regard to lice.  I haven't yet used it for preventive purposes.

I did get rid of the lice/nits within 7 days or so, but I did a lot of combing during that time.  Still, I have a hunch this shampoo contributed to me not getting the lice back since there were probably nits lying around on clothes and furniture (I had the itching for a few weeks before realizing what it was).

The second time, I left it on again for 10 minutes, and this time it completely removed it. The scent of the shampoo was nice, and not too overwhelming. The color of it was dark dark blue that turned lighter as you applied it. What I noticed is that you have to go in sections and apply the shampoo evenly so that way it can completely and evenly coat your hair. All positive from me, I don’t have any complaints at all. This is my go to and definitely great for the price.",2022-03-16 01:37:17.217994

I thought maybe the reviews were old and they had fixed the issue but I received my package with “purple” shampoo all over the package. Only to inspect it further & see it was actually the blue bottle leaking. I wondered why it looked purple so I compared the two & both bottles have the exact same purple shampoo in it. I bought this primarily for the blue shampoo & I have to question the authenticity with this issue. I have a feeling this is a counterfeit item & should have known better than to order a beauty product on Amazon.,2022-03-16 01:37:17.217994

I figured I would do it to help other people out because I’m a kind of person who always looks at 3748292847 million reviews when but something. So I have seen other people but this and it is damaged when it comes in the mail. I have not used it yet. I’m going to upload pictures a before and after to show you guys what one use looks like !! I have dark brown hair now ! Im trying to do a balayage. Right now my hair is in the stage where it is yellow with just a little brass so I figured why not get these two shampoos and maybe mix it together and let it set in my hair. These pictures are a before and after. The one of me taking a picture in the mirror is before and the side view is after. This is after one use only. Left of hair for 2 mins next time will leave on hair for 5 mins. On the bottle it says leave on for 1-5 mins! So I didn’t wanna leave it on too long because I never used it before. I used gloves but I don’t think it will stain your hands if you wash right away. Since they work together very well if you just get one or the other it will work for your hair if you have yellow hair or brassy hair. I was surprised how it took MOST of the yellow out !! With sitting in my hair only for two mins!! I will leave my name at the end of this so you can look at for when I do use it again. I’m reallt not sure how many times you can use this. I was told you are supposed to use this shampoo twice a week. My friend said she uses it every other day and her hair is white blonde !! It don’t smell too bad either. But if your like me and in the process of coloring your hair to help keep moisture in your hair I would use “ it’s a ten mask “ as conditioner. That stuff WORKS ! Love it. It’s expensive but I will pay for it. Helps with everything !!-lindsay,2022-03-16 01:37:17.217994

B01MU9VI4Q,2022,3,16,1,This shampoo does exactly what it’s designed to do!,5.0 out of 5 stars,457 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2018",Vic,,Verified Purchase,,"Blonde hair is a job to maintain if you naturally have a darker shade of hair. A lot of the reviews left on this product are from ladies with not enough education on how the blonde hair/purple shampoo fully work. The comments saying that it made their hair bluish/purplish and leaving negative feedback is because there’s no education behind how purple and blonde work together. The dryness of the hair after using this product is also uneducated...Who would think that by bleaching your hair and maintaining a color that’s not naturally your color is going to not dry your hair out? There’s a double edged sword here.  You want light blonde hair, here’s some things to remember when using a purple shampoo...1- the opposite of blonde is purple, so the shampoo helps brighten your dingy blonde. It’s not unusual for your hair to have hints of purple the first time through. It WILL wash out the second or third time. 2- you’re using purple shampoo to lift some brassiness off of your hair. It’s not unusual for your hair to be slightly drier when you rinse the shampoo out. Your hair WILL go back to normal the second or third wash. 3- use the purple shampoo every 3 or 4 times you wash your hair. Don’t lean on this as your daily shampoo. The more frequently you use it, the drier your hair will become. The product does exactly what it’s supposed to do if you use it correctly. I applied the shampoo on dry hair and left it on for abou 10 minutes, then washed it out and followed with conditioner. This helps brighten the hair (as well as give it the purple pigment, as it should) without diluting the shampoo with water. I was going for a brighter look. Using it to shampoo your hair in the shower for a minute will do the trick, too, but keep in mind that the shampoo gets diluted when water is added to it, causing it to not lift as much beassiness as you may want.

My hair is naturally dark so in order to get the nice ash blonde hair color that I like, it has to go through a brassy-orange stage. I've tried other 'purple' shampoos and this shampoo has been the most effective. It does stain your hands a bit so I suggest using some disposable vinyl gloves. It comes with a conditioner that smells like cupcakes. I only use it for 5 mins otherwise my hair will get a slight purple tint.

I read lots of reviews and watched some YouTube videos. A lot of the videos are about how to turn your hair white or purple which isn't what I wanted, but there were some that were about how to remove the brassy color. My first tip is to start slow. The first time I used it I left it on for 1 minute, now I'm leaving it on for 3 minutes. Better safe than sorry. Play around with the timing but be cautious and go longer the next time if you're not happy with the result. Your hands turn purple, but wash them right after you apply the shampoo and it will wash off (duh).  Have a cleaning rag in the shower to wipe down all of the purple splatters, it might be hard to remove if you let it dry, so just take care of it right away. It is pretty drying, so use conditioner after you wash the shampoo out. I have been using it once a week, and that's working for me.",2022-03-16 01:40:37.553610

After several days of use, my scalp was itching SO bad that I realized it had to be the shampoo, and I was having some kind of allergic reaction to it. Plus, my hair was not only feeling less oily, it was starting to look dry and frail, which is almost worse. I stopped using the shampoo, but even now--a month later--my scalp is still dry and extremely itchy. I have no idea how to treat it, and I'm back to finding a new shampoo.

I found Pure Argan Oil Shampoo through an online video recommendation as well as a few online publications for color treated hair and beards, and have been using it since. My beard looks fantastic, smells great, is soft to the touch, and it protects my beard hair follicles. Additionally, because the shampoo leaves my skin soft and moisturized, I wind up needing to use less beard oil. So the color lasts even longer than I expected, allowing me to go around 2 weeks between touch-ups. Of course, it works great on my scalp hair as well, so it's a one-stop-shop, and a double win for me. In all honesty, it's been my Pure Argan was everything I hope and more.

I would describe the scent as ""clinical""....it's not pleasant at all. Despite the offputting smell, I used the shampoo on Monday morning. I washed once and didn't get much lather, so I used a little more and washed again, then followed up with my usual conditioner. Once my hair dried, it felt very dried out, stripped, and stiff after using this shampoo, even though I had used my normal conditioner which always makes my hair very soft and silky. Not this time....it wasn't enough to combat the dryness this shampoo caused. It totally stripped my hair. (For reference, I am a Caucasian female with long, color treated brown, 3a/3b curly hair and I don't use heat on my hair...I even air dry it). To reiterate, I used this shampoo on Monday. Now this is where the story gets scary. I woke up today (3 days after using this shampoo) and discovered a BALD SPOT about the size of a dime located in the very center of my hair about 1cm back from my hairline.  It is VERY NOTICABLE! I have never in my life had a bald spot. My hair is not thinning, and no baldness runs in my family either male or female. So imagine my shock when my normally thick hair has a HOLE in it. The skin on my scalp is not inflamed or injured in any way, nor was my hair pulled out by me or anyone else....my hair is simply GONE.  I am not blaming my bald spot on this shampoo, but it is the ONLY thing I have done differently with my haircare routine for about a year. It could just be a coincidence, but it is a very scary coincidence. I have a Dr Appointment next week to rule out any medical issues, and if I discover it is indeed a medical issue, I will alter this review, because I do not want to be unfair to this product. However, I felt I had to share this story based on the chance that this shampoo might be the cause. I just want to save others from the mental pain I'm experiencing right now as I walk around with a large bald spot on the front of my head.",2022-03-16 01:52:17.650749

It is like a miracle for me. I've been fighting itchy rashy eczema on my hands and it was spreading to my arms, and I had never had it in my life. This went on for 2 years, and my dermatologist put me on 3 or 4 different creams and/or steroid creams and none worked. I also used at least 10 different natural creams, oils, washes, etc. and NOTHING worked. I even tried fungal creams! Naturally, that didn't work, as it wasn't a fungal rash! Desperate people do desperate things. I love Aveeno products and had tried several, but did not know they had eczema therapy products. I discovered them on Amazon and figured why not try? So I always wash my hands with the special wash (I just put it by my sink, since it's a pump), and I follow up with the Eczema Therapy Moisturizing pump lotion/cream, and I use the thick colloidal cream only at night. Within ONE WEEK, my eczema stopped itching and started to fade! In 2 weeks, it was totally gone! I am ecstatic! I showed my husband and we were both in shock! I mean, I have tried EVERYTHING! Even an expensive honey from New Zealand that did nothing! This is the best most remarkable stuff I ever used and now my hands are soft and totally clear, and I can wear bracelets and rings again! I am getting some for a friend who has way more severe eczema all over than I had, but she's tried everything too, so maybe it could work for her.

I use tea tree & eucalyptus in everything for 15 years, it is my go-to scent for all things body, hair, face, creams. None if the other 50+ products I’ve used has dried me out. I have to return it for the smell alone. It is distinctly odorous like a dry scalp shampoo coal smell. It is not pleasant & after my shower I smelled so…distinct that I had to re-shower with another soap to wash off  & mask the smell. The purpose was to soothe & hydrate skin, which is does not do. It also claims to work on athlete’s foot & cure up some tougher ailments: this might work for you in the way a terrible smelling dry scalp shampoo will work…it does clean & bc the smell is so bad I’m guessing it could help with really tough odors.",2022-03-16 02:17:05.002475

Overall why on earth would any body wash contain such ingredients as to cause reproductive warnings? I just think we here in America are very lax about all these products containing dangerous ingredients.

The rental provided the Basil scent, which we all loved.  I ordered 3-packs of that scent and 3 other scents, with the assumption that we would enjoy them as much as before.  These soaps are nothing like the experience at the vacation rental!  We all believe that these soaps at Amazon are some sort of knock-off made by a third-party contractor.  The soap does not lather, so you will tend to use more, and the scents are so off-putting!!! They are totally different from the original experience.  The four scents I ordered were--Rhubarb, Lemon Verbena, Basil and Bluebell.  They are listed from most disgusting to least offensive.  You're welcome.  The Rhubarb is a cross between raw rhubarb and dirt (NOT rhubarb pie), the Lemon Verbena smells like prairie grass after it's been in a heavy rain then the sun comes out, making it steam out a ""this is why I hate humidity"" smell.  The Basil has an herbal smell of some combination that should never be, and the Bluebell is a little too floral.  On a bright note, since you need to use more soap to get it to lather, you'll get through it faster, and maybe you won't have exposed all your friends to the abuse of the unpleasant odors.  They may question your tastes, doubt the friendship, and become scarce--it's that bad!!!  If you buy too much of it, like I did, you can save it for out-of-town guests that decide to overstay their welcome.  Out comes the soap, and voila!  Guests leave, problem solved!!

My only issue with these hand soaps is the design of the pump. The old ones had an issue with the bottles getting all squished because no air would get in to take the soap's place. The new bottles do not have that problem but have an even worse problem; the pump part does not come back up after pressing it down and you have to manually pull it back up after each squirt. I don't know who designed these pumps but that is completely unacceptable and very irritating.

Though it was listed as returnable, the seller charged $12 for a return and required a trip to UPS during the deadliest month of the pandemic.

I've used it for 5 years now and it never gets old. I love it so much that I would not hesitate to purchase it again from a different vendor, or just l'occitane (hence, the 3 star rating). It smells amazing and lasts for a really long time. It's a very comforting relaxing smell and if you like the smell of almond, you will enjoy this product. There are very few beauty products that I'm willing to spend $25.00 on for an 8.4oz bottle, but this is one of them. CONS: I just wanted to warn others purchasing this, that your bottle should ALWAYS be filled to the brim. If you ever receive a bottle that is not filled to the top, something has gone wrong, and you should return it. A lot of people won't realize that when they receive this product UNLESS they are familiar with it.

The one I was using cost $10 per bar, so I thought I would try this brand for $3 per bar instead. This soap leaves my skin feeling just as clean and smooth but for a fraction of the cost. I did have some drying/flaking for the first 1-2 uses but now my skin is used to it, and I also use a moisturizer anyways because I can have dry/oily skin. This type of soap has seemed to work beat with my skin- helping to clear up acne, doesn’t leave a weird residue, leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth, and doesn’t overly dry it out. If you are a fan of Dead Sea soaps, this one works just as well and costs much less. Doesn’t really have a smell; seems kind of neutral on that front.",2022-03-16 02:24:13.241377

I felt that I would go through the entire bottle in a short period of time due to constantly re-applying it to my bath mitt. I did not like this product at all because of the no-suds factor. I have to say that it did do a good job in that my skin did not itch when I got out of the shower. However I will not use it again and would only recommend it to anyone who doesn’t mind that it doesn’t make suds.",2022-03-16 02:33:14.110938

Went to my doctor and said that I have a mild form of Eczema. got recommened this product and a prescription cream. I gotta say, this has worked wonders. 2 weeks of non stop itch and taking antihistamine since I thought I have allergies, when all I really needed was this! Just 3 days of using it so far and bam, the itch is almost entirely gone and I can sleep at  night again, 90% itch free. Plus, I feel like my skin is extra moisturized and feels nice and smooth/softer to the touch the before. Highly recommend!

This scalp shampoo does everything it says it will and more.  I've used numerous scalp shampoos in an effort to sooth my super itchy scalp and to remove the small scabs that ""would"" but no longer developed all over my scalp. I've been using T-Sal and I'd also scrub my scalp with a soft scrub brush. While this approach helped to scale back the itching, it still didn't get rid of all the itching and I still had scabs forming on my scalp as well. I also used Scalpacin anti-itch liquid and while that too helped but I still had constant itching and scabs arbitrarily forming on my scalp. Finally, I saw this ProBliva Fungus Shampoo online - after reading the reviews I decided to purchase ProBliva Fungus Shampoo and give it a go - I couldn't be happier with the results! After just one application my scalp felt noticeably better. After a week of using Pro Bolivar my scalp feels entirely normal - NO ITCHING WHATSOEVER AND ALL THE SCABS HAVE HEALED UP AND GONE AWAY!

Sure, it's pretty and it's fine to hold, but I don't think the shape is ideal to rub on your head. I MUCH prefer the usual round shape, which all other shampoo bars use. I am guessing someone designed this convoluted shape to differentiate it from all the others, but in my opinion this bizarrely shaped (although aesthetically pleasing) bar isn't an improvement.

Contains tea tree oil and eucalyptus so it provides antiseptic value. Family members have used it and it has helped clear acne, breakouts, and skin related rashes from jock itch etc. It doesn't seem to dry skin. You will notice a slight medicinal smell upon dispensing from tea tree oil and Eucalyptus but that is to be expected. Don't expect it to lather like store soaps but it CLEANS VERY well! I bought the bottle with the pump, it doesn't come with one anymore. I recommend you get a pump dispenser to place on the bottle. Will make it very easy to dispense in shower. If your skin feels oily and dirty or sticky....wash with this! Does a fantastic job! I used to use Nubian but they sold out to a large company and changed all the formula's which make it HORRIBLE. So I stopped using it and moved to this. Highly recommend and I hope they continue to LEAVE the formula intact and DON'T sell out to a large company! GREAT standard soap product and I hope they continue to support the groups and families like they say they do on the side of the bottle!",2022-03-16 02:49:28.794011

The product moisturized my hair and I can already feel a texture difference! There is also literally little to no frizz at all. I did end up using it as a face wash because I forgot mine outside of the shower and I was too lazy to get it and so I used it because it says on the bottle it can be used as a face wash and my skin was legitimately clear by the morning. I had an acne scar that wouldn’t go away and two pimples that were killing my self esteem and after washing my face it felt amazing and in the morning the scar had faded to practically nothing and the pimples were completely gone!

The first ingredient is NEEM which for avid planthusiasts, is a necessity for fighting off pests that arise. The fact is also, neem oil is best used when you mix it with some sort of soap to help it bind together to spray on your leaves. I was desperate one day to clean my dusty leaves and figured that this organic formula is actually PERFECT as long as you dilute the soap with lots of water. I used one tiny pump with lots water and mixed it in a spray bottle onto a microfiber cloth. This concoction worked BEAUTIFULLY for getting the job done and I haven’t gotten any pests since then. My leaves are so shiny and beautiful and since taking off that layer of dust on them, they have been growing faster as there’s nothing impeding them from  receiving ample light. I do believe the original version is best for this HACK since we don’t know how the essential oils on the other options are going to react to your plants. As far as a body cleanser, it is nice however I still prefer something with SLS from time to time to get rid of grime and a little funk from the underarms. I usually have something strictly for those CREVASSES (play on words thanks to Tenacious D, IYKYK). Hope this helps y’all!",2022-03-16 03:02:12.370875

I ordered Green Tea Lemongrass scent, however, it smells like orange. Not just a hint, it's a smack you in the face with righteous indignation ORANGE! For many, this is not a big deal, may even be awesome to feel like a major league pitcher threw an orange fresh from the tree at 90 mph that slammed right between your eyes while standing in the middle of a Florida orange grove. However, I detest the fragrance (also the taste/flavor) of oranges. Needless to say when my husband was decanting it into a smaller pump dispenser for our bathroom he was shocked that I purchased something orange, his favorite. I thought I could deal since it was open, and my orange aficionado husband was happy...and again, it was already open. I was wrong. The scent is not light. However, the nausea from the fragrance has really shortened my shower time in the morning and I am also much more alert as I am trying to keep my stomach settled. I would take off 2 stars for the fragrance (I have a true disdain for oranges) but the scent doesn't linger on your skin so since it's just 3-10 minutes a day in the underworld I kick 1 star.

I’ve been using dr.bonners soap for at least 35 years, probably more. I also used bio clean face wash. But..a year ago, I went online to buy those and realized I could no longer afford them. Distressed, I look around and found this one. Very scary, really, to buy an entire gallon of something I knew nothing about..  but, price was good, ingredients looked good so because Amazon has such a good return policy I decided to take a risk. When it arrived, I immediately loved the fragile smell. But I’m so sensitive to orders I worried the fragrance might stick to my skin and smell artificial..it didn’t. .  Right, so being happy with the fragrance and later with the beautiful feel of it, I still didn’t write a review because I was curious if it would start smelling ‘off,’. As dr. Bonners often does. Right, so I’m writing to say this gallon has lasted me one full year with no deterioration that I can ferrite out. And, I think I said, i really am very sensitive to that kind of stuff.

I was happy to find that it lacks both coconut and aloe, since my hair is sensitive to those. Its proteins are small (amino acids), so good for both low- and high-porosity hair. Overall this shampoo works well, but I find that other shampoos have comparable ingredient profiles and work equally well for the price. Typically shampoo doesn't sit on your hair long enough for many proteins to stick around, so if you're on a budget I'd focus on an AG conditioner or leave-in rather than their shampoo per se",2022-03-16 01:11:02.876457

So the search was on to find the perfect body wash for multiple reasons - better more organic ingredients, better more natural smell (vs that fabricated scent that doesn't last long or makes you gag), easy on my skin (to potentially lessen my back acne), and doesn't leave a ""slimy"" or ""sticky"" residue behind - just to name a few. I've spent a lot of money on different ""organic"", sea salt heavy or charcoal based gel & barred body wash/soaps. None of them have met all the needs I personally wanted until I found this Black Wolf Nation charcoal body wash. It smells greats, lathers well, gets me clean, is easy on my skin & leaves zero residue behind after rinsing.

        TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,I have been using the Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening shampoo and conditioner for years now.  My hair stylist first recommended it and it has worked really well on my fine and thin men's hair.  I think some get this thinking it is going to provide fuller and thicker hair that remains and does not go away.  Meaning it will over time provide permanently thicker hair.  That just is not possible.  What this does do with consistent use is after I wash with the shampoo and then use the conditioner is provide fuller and softer hair after each wash.  The fullness is very refreshing and natural.  This shampoo smells very nice and lathers up very easily.  With other shampoos I would feel build-up over time but not with this.  I also appreciate the savings buying it in large volume like here.  But what I do not appreciate it that even when purchased from Amazon themselves as I made sure to do this time the large bottle arrived with some of the shampoo leaking out the top.  It was all over the bottle and a pain to wash off but overall a minimal amount though no amount should be the correct amount.  But the shampoo itself will indeed add volume in a natural way to fine and thinning hair.,2022-03-17 00:07:27.557409

One day my stylist used the Paul Mitchell special shampoo and conditioner on me at the salon and I found myself totally in love with the smell and the way the it made my scalp tingle... And once my hair was dried and styled, I was excited to see some oomph despite the stylist not using any other volumizing products. When I asked her about it I was expecting her to tell me that it was one of the usual high end products that are normally used at salons- you know, the ones that cost like $50 a bottle- but was thrilled to learn how inexpensive they are despite their good quality. Needless to say, I ended up leaving the salon with a couple of bottles and it's been my standard shampoo/conditioner ever since. I have tried other products over the years, such as specialty shampoos that promise to improve strength, growth, and volume, but I always find myself going back to this. I really do feel that my hair is healthier and grows more quickly because of it. I also love this brand because there are several different types and scents To choose from (not sure if they are all technically part of the ""special"" line, but they do come in the same little green bottles, unlike the other Paul Mitchell products) and I've enjoyed playing around with different combinations. Currently my favorite combo is the lemon sage shampoo with the lavender mint conditioner (although I do still love the tea tree shampoo as well). I've been using these products for about 5 years now and I plan to continue using them so long as they stay available and affordable. And I absolutely recommend them to anyone with fine, flat hair like mine!",2022-03-17 00:07:27.557409

Since it is so thick it usually weighs down and the top of my hair on my head just flattened out, but this shampoo has really been helping with that.

This one I’m reviewing (green bottle) is more drying.  So I switch back and forth to keep from drying my hair out too much with the green, or weighing it down too much with the white.

Over the last few years, it has begun to thin gradually. Nothing crazy, but over time its lost some of its volume. Not to a point that a nice wash with a good shampoo wouldn't be able to hide any noticeable lack of coverage. I've used Organix (OGX) biotin shampoo, Avalon Organics biotin etc. and was happy with both. Nothing but typical couple loose hairs while shampooing or a few loose hairs when brushing afterwards. I was running low and decided to give this biotin a try seeing it had added claims such as DHT blocking properties.  I cannot regret that decision more. After a couple weeks of using this product my hair began falling out in clumps and my scalp became extremely itchy and flaky. Its typical for anyone to lose up to 100 hairs a day but this lead to over 100 per wash and every brush. I'd brush in the afternoon to check if it was still happening when dry and I'd lose even more. All I had to do was run a flat hand down my head and I'd be picking up 50 or more hairs out of the sink. I stopped immediately after realizing it had to be the shampoo. After a couple weeks of stopping with the shampoo the constant extreme itching has stopped and the flakes have lessened significantly but the hair fall is still more than I've ever experienced at any other time in my life.

I wash my hair every 3 to 4 days. With more expensive shampoo, my hair doesn’t get greasy until the fourth day. I wash my hair twice. First time with two pumps of product, the second time with one pump of product. Trying OGX, I had to use a ton of the product twice to get my hair clean. Even with this, I felt a heavy residue after thoroughly rinsing, and my hair was greasy by the next day. Some might like the scent of the product, but I found the heavy vanilla like smell to be too heavy and rather noxious. Because of how much product I had to use, I’m ultimately not saving any money from more expensive products that I use significantly less of. I’m not even going to bother using this product again. Maybe I’ll use it up on my dogs or just dump it. Ultimately, this product does not give extra volume. It leaves a heavy residue and makes your hair greasy much sooner than better products.",2022-03-17 00:08:30.536019

I like the scent as well... it's hard to describe but I prefer just a clean scent (NO FLORAL), this is a little sweet (but not sickeningly).

I bought this product along with the corresponding conditioner upon recommendation from my hairstylist, and at first I thought it was a miracle, because it made my hair so soft and sleek. I was so excited, and spent $60 bucks on more of it after I used my first order. However- around the 6 month mark, I noticed my scalp was flaking more than usual. I chalked it up to winter weather, and ignored it - until I started noticing scabby patches appearing under my hair. I could not understand what was causing it, and tried discontinuing leave in conditioners, and changing pillowcases and diet- but nothing worked. The final straw was when my follicles started detaching: hair would drift down from my head in the middle of the day and I would see it on my shirts or in my car. It was awful- and then when I was reordering this shampoo, I noticed one of the one star reviews ALSO mentioned hair loss and dry scalp. I stopped using it and my scalp healed by the next week, and my hair loss has stopped over the last month. I switched to Garnier triple nutrition and that works way better with no irritation, and costs $7 at Target. So I would not recommend this- I spent $120 prolonging my hair recovery journey.",2022-03-17 00:09:23.958882

So I’ve never purchased Redkin Allsoft before, so I can’t speak to this formula’s authenticity, however I can say it has made my hair gorgeous! I love love LOVE the feel this has given my hair. I had fried my hair with years of bleaching it and decided to dye it my natural color and let it grow. My hair had been looking so harsh and dried out, but once I started using this, from the very first use it became much more soft and manageable. I will admit, The first week my scalp did get quite a few pimples along the hair line, but I have very sensitive skin so any changes to my routine usually causes breakouts. So maybe those that are complaining have not given their skin enough time to adapt to the change. I think the scent is perfect, and smells just like the salon quality stuff. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and use Biosilk before drying my hair and my hair has never been softer.",2022-03-17 00:10:26.828157

B086CS8YXB,2022,3,17,1,Secret Hair Growth,5.0 out of 5 stars,58 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2021",Amy H,,Verified Purchase,,"My goal for this product was to achieve hair growth which may not be your primary motivation. About two years ago I noticed that my hair was thinning badly. I’m going to be 58 next month and I have left  what used to constitute One pigtail that’s now a single ponytail.  . I had the classic male pattern thinning above my temples and with my bangs. I was completely freaking out as my hair is kind of my signature feature. It’s always been wavy and fine but pretty. I also let my silver grow out about four years ago and the lack of processing has made my hair healthy,  shiny and soft. At the end of 2018 I embarked on this research project about how to re-grow my hair and keep what I have from hair care products, the way that I treat my hair,  and nutrition. They said not to keep your hair tightly wrapped up and to let it flow, that washing your hair every other day was better because it removes buildup on the scalp, so I dumped the Pantene and tried the biotin shampoo starting two years ago. At the same time I start Taking the 5000 mg of biotin pills for hair and nails from natures bounty that I got at Costco. And at the beginning of 2019 I research which vitamins and foods to eat which include anything high in vitamin A like red and yellow bell peppers, red cabbage, spinach, Sweet potatoes, Butternut squash and cauliflower… along with almonds sunflower seeds salmon eggs and Greek yogurt.  I bough this Nizoral In April 2019. As of today I have an entire undercoat of fine new hair but it’s only about 4 inches which leads me to believe that the biotin shampoo really didn’t affect things all that much. Four Inches of hair growth is about 8 months. So I went back on to Amazon to see you when I first bought this  dandruff shampoo and lo and behold it was in April which is eight months today - January 1, 2021. I do believe that nutrition is key along with stress management and sleep course. But I find it really interesting that I’m able to trace the number of inches to when I bought this shampoo.  I don’t know if it’s 100% direct correlation but I can testify that is working for me in the hair growth department. I also found a different hair growth vitamin that I’m going to start using next week.  It’s called Hair La Vie.  Last observation. I did use Nioxin 3  for a number of years and I don’t think it worked as well as the shampoo coupled with the nutrition. Because I still had a lot of hair thinning of the temples which is now filling in considerably. And also Nioxin dries your hair out badly. I like alternating between the biotin shampoo and this dandruff shampoo because the Biotin Shampoo is less drying than Nizoral.  The key is to get it worked up into your scalp really well and just let it sit there for a while so you have to like use it less often. I hope this helps you I know How agonizing it is to lose your hair especially when you’re a woman. Good luck",2022-03-17 00:10:33.766137

It smells more like essential oils which tend to have a more powerful scent, but it still isn't overly powerful to me (and everything gives me headaches if it is). I have found the conditioner isn't as moisturizing as it claims to be if your hair is processed or overly processed from lightening or dyeing. I definitely recommend using this in lieu of a deep conditioning treatment.

I bought it in hopes of changing the outermost layer from a light blonde back to silver which hasn't happened. I don't know why some of my hair turned blonde--regular shampoo, leave-in hair products to keep my very thick unruly hair tame, or too much sun except I always wear a hat? It used to be very dark chestnut brown in my youth (never blonde). I never died my hair, it started changing to salt & pepper in my early 30s, now more salt than pepper in my early 60s. Strangers, even hair dressers, told me how beautiful my hair color was, I could trust them over family/friends :-)  Six yrs ago my hairdresser helped me grow it out from a very short style and suggested shampoo for silver hair which I never tried until this. I've been thinking if it was still short, cut regularly, this lavender tinting wouldn't have happened, but just today I noticed an attractive woman with almost white short hair and could see a slight tint of lavender to it! I asked my husband if I was imagining it, he said no, he saw it too. From what others have reviewed this doesn't happen to everyone but it can happen! I've now tossed this shampoo & conditioner and have bought a shampoo for blonde hair promising to make it two shades lighter in hopes it might remove the lavender and the blonde from my hair. I just hope like one reviewer mentioned that it doesn't turn green! I may have to have it cut very short again and start over. Of course these days any color, every color, seems to be in :-) It's amazing that young women are dying their hair to look grey which usually has a lavender or blue tint to it.",2022-03-17 00:12:03.870054

My hair was brittle and seemed always dry no matter what products I would put on it. I thought that I would have had to cut my hair and start completely over. However, when my products arrived, I could not wait to give them a try. I love the smells. Very nice and not powerful. I washed my hair twice with the Nexxus Shampoo, first time just the scalp, and the second wash, the hair itself. The way that my hair reacted to this shampoo was breathtaking! My curls appeared and believe it or not, I was able to pull a comb through my thick, natural, 4C  hair!! I have never, ever been able to do this before while washing. Barely any hair was coming out in my comb! I had not even used the conditioner yet. I just had to stop and look in the mirror and talk to myself saying, ""Omg, I cannot believe this""! I have never, ever experienced a shampoo doing my hair like this before. After I completely rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I moved on to the Nexxus Conditioner. Even more amazing. It stated to leave on the hair for 3 min, but I sat under a hooded dryer for about 10min with the conditioner on my hair, under a plastic cap. Once my time was up, I rinsed away all of the conditioner. My hair was so manageable!! I was able to comb and section it to do my bantu knots and allow my hair to dry overnight. After washing my hair, it only took me about 30 min to get it  all done to dry. I have never been able to complete this process this quickly before! I am highly satisfied with these products! Even though they are  expensive products, I'm hooked and will be purchasing again. I told my mom about my experience and am ready to try it on her hair also, to see if she gets the same experience and satisfaction that I got. Thank you Nexxus for such wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them. Definitely a must try on the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner for Severely damaged hair. This is my first time ever writing a review on a product. That's how pleased I was with these products!!",2022-03-17 00:12:31.378584

I will say that if you are sensitive to perfume smells, this may be too strong for you. I enjoy the sent and the fact that my hair holds that sent beyond 24 hours. Even after using a different shampoo for a day, the smell of this one still comes through. Also, if you are prone to greasy hair, this may make it worse.

I will say that I was worried at first while I was washing my hair because it felt “heavy” and like my hair would be greasy as someone else in the reviews had stated. I do have thin hair so this is a concern. However what you need to know is that as soon as you put the conditioner on that feeling disappears so make sure you condition all the way to your roots. I know that’s typically not recommended but I believe this shampoo and conditioner are made to treat and repair the entire hair strand. Also, it smells amazing. The thing I would compare the smell to is the Moroccan hair treatment oils that are out there. Very pleasant and it lasts after styling which I like because I love to smell good! If you’re unsure whether you’ll like this shampoo then buy the smaller bottles first.

Try using this product for a month and then evaluate your results. I still need to use dry shampoo, but I have tried a lot of products and have found nothing better than this.

I leave it on for the 2-3 minutes suggested, but do not do a second application and rinse because it really does not seem necessary. The product succeeds in leaving my hair feeling clean and does seem to work at doing some degreasing. You MUST use conditioner on the tips of your hair every time after using this shampoo, because it does leave your hair feeling very dry. I'm also not a big fan of the smell, but it's not bad, just not something I would ever buy or wear for the scent alone. Luckily, my conditioner and other hair product take care of that. It's only been a week, so I will come back when it's been a few more weeks, but for now, it's not made anything worse, but it will take some more results for me to come back for a second purchase when I use this bottle up.",2022-03-17 00:12:38.830410

        TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",Verified Purchase,,I have been using the Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening shampoo and conditioner for years now.  My hair stylist first recommended it and it has worked really well on my fine and thin men's hair.  I think some get this thinking it is going to provide fuller and thicker hair that remains and does not go away.  Meaning it will over time provide permanently thicker hair.  That just is not possible.  What this does do with consistent use is after I wash with the shampoo and then use the conditioner is provide fuller and softer hair after each wash.  The fullness is very refreshing and natural.  This shampoo smells very nice and lathers up very easily.  With other shampoos I would feel build-up over time but not with this.  I also appreciate the savings buying it in large volume like here.  But what I do not appreciate it that even when purchased from Amazon themselves as I made sure to do this time the large bottle arrived with some of the shampoo leaking out the top.  It was all over the bottle and a pain to wash off but overall a minimal amount though no amount should be the correct amount.  But the shampoo itself will indeed add volume in a natural way to fine and thinning hair.,2022-03-17 00:13:15.116267

One day my stylist used the Paul Mitchell special shampoo and conditioner on me at the salon and I found myself totally in love with the smell and the way the it made my scalp tingle... And once my hair was dried and styled, I was excited to see some oomph despite the stylist not using any other volumizing products. When I asked her about it I was expecting her to tell me that it was one of the usual high end products that are normally used at salons- you know, the ones that cost like $50 a bottle- but was thrilled to learn how inexpensive they are despite their good quality. Needless to say, I ended up leaving the salon with a couple of bottles and it's been my standard shampoo/conditioner ever since. I have tried other products over the years, such as specialty shampoos that promise to improve strength, growth, and volume, but I always find myself going back to this. I really do feel that my hair is healthier and grows more quickly because of it. I also love this brand because there are several different types and scents To choose from (not sure if they are all technically part of the ""special"" line, but they do come in the same little green bottles, unlike the other Paul Mitchell products) and I've enjoyed playing around with different combinations. Currently my favorite combo is the lemon sage shampoo with the lavender mint conditioner (although I do still love the tea tree shampoo as well). I've been using these products for about 5 years now and I plan to continue using them so long as they stay available and affordable.

(1) I have no idea if this is supposed to for all hair types. It isn't. (2) In 2016 my husband and I went through a stressful time with a company - not wow - that ruined my stress level and caused my hair to thin out more than what it already was. When dealing with that company was done with, my hair was not thinning out as much and i wanted to try and get new hair growing in and work in decreasing hair falling out. I tried the wow acv and I noticed more hair was coming out than regular shampoo. I read it was not really for helping hair to grow back so I stopped. However, my oldest, who had incredible thick hair, used it because she loved the smell of it. She stopped using it after a month, but never said why until recently. Will get to that in a bit. (2) I started using the wow coconut to help with stimulating hair growth. THe hair loss was the same for women my age with thin hair. early 40's it happens but was not that bad at all. I only wanted to stimulate the hair growth where it was showing thinness in some areas. I used the wow coconut the first time. 3-4 times the hair came out than with regular shampoo. I used regular shampoo the next time. the usual 5-15 strands of hair would come out. I would hten use the coconut. 3-4 times the hair comes out than with regular shampoo. I emailed wow and they said not to use any other shampoo and to only use theirs to be effective. I then washed my hair with wow coconut and 3-4 times the hair came out than with regular shampoo. didn't wash it for 2 days. used coconut wow shampoo again, 3-4 times the hair came out. waited another two days before washing my hair again. I was nervous to use it again, but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. washed it and sure enough. 3-4 times the hair loss from regular shampoo. I know everyone loses on average 100 strands of hair a day, but this was insane. I then decided I was done and I needed to find the shampoo that did work for stimulating hair growth and did work (the only reason I stopped that one was because the peppermint was so strong it made me lightheaded, but I would rather wash my hair in the kitchen sink and endure the strong peppermint and have a product that works then lose hair with wow). I had asked my oldest who used the wow acv if she still uses it. she said no. I asked her why because I was curious if it was causing her beautiful think hair to thin out and it thinned out a lot. she flat out said she stopped using it because of all the hair that was falling out when she used it. She went from having to have her hair thinned out every 2-3 months with a pile that looked like a small bunny to having thin hair. This only happened when she used the wow. She said when she uses anything but wow, she has no problems with hair falling out. I don't know why the wow coconut and acv shampoos made our hair fall out, I was really having hopes with all the reviews, but there is nothing wrong with either of us for our hair to be falling out like this. Again, it only falls out 3-4 more when we use the wow coconut and acv. If we use suave, tressemme, herbal essence, we do not have an issue at all. We have the normal amount fall out that we have our entire lives that is common for everyone. I will be seeing if I can return it since it is in the time frame. I want to keep my hair. Not have it thin out 3-4 times faster than what it normally would have.",2022-03-17 00:13:29.114993

I feel like the people that gave this a bad review did not give it a chance to actually work so I stuck through and kept using it after one week of using the shampoo and conditioner I stopped losing gobs of hair in the shower Before this I even quit washing my hair because I was tired of losing so much hair I really feel that it was the store-bought shampoos that I was using they have shelflife chemicals in them they’re just not good. this shampoo I can honestly say has improved the amount of hair that I was losing in between washes I can also say I am seeing a little bit of hair growth I’m gonna give it like I said three more months to see where were at.

It does  not weigh my hair down or cause it to look or feel oily/greasy.  Quite the opposite.

I have very thick, oily, and heavy hair that after about 12 hours, feels greasy (and sometimes looks it too). About a month ago I realized I wasn't able to fully wash product out of my head even when using just a little bit and washing it out for 30+ minutes. Every single day after drying my hair for over an hour, I'd find a clump of shampoo/conditioner stuck in the back of my head. I couldn't get this out no matter what treatments I did, no matter what product I used, etc. I went through multiple bottles and brands of shampoos and none of it worked. I then came across this product and bought it as my last hope. I washed with this shampoo two days in a row and my hair no longer has left over product it, it stays soft and light for over 24 hours now, and I can't say enough good things about the consistency and sent of the product itself.

I’ve been a Biolage user for years. I always used the shampoo and conditioner for colored hair, even though I didn’t color my hair all the time, maybe once a year on a whim. That always worked well for me. I decided to try the micro oil shampoo/conditioner, because I felt like my scalp was getting too dry. That was unfortunately a mistake. This caused a lot of build up of product on my scalp and my hair to be so greasy! I did make sure I rinsed aggressively to get all the product out, and I only us conditioner on my scalp once a week. That being said, the conditioner worked great for my ends. I decided I needed a scalp reset so I bought this shampoo, and it’s been a world of difference!

One of my favorite pastimes is shaving my whole body, putting on a speedo, oiling myself up and diving down the lanes at the bowling alley while people are playing. You might ask why I do this and it’s hard for me to really pinpoint exactly. Maybe it’s the attention. Maybe it’s about how sexy I feel while lubed up in a Speedo. Maybe I like the abuse of angry, fat, stinky guys trying to hit me with their bowling balls as I glide over the lanes on my belly, feeling majestic af. Who knows…..yet I digress. Anyways, I used this shampoo as my body lube and I was not disappointed. It created optimal sliding conditions, slathered all over my hairless body. And that’s all I was really looking for but it turns out it also was fantastic for my skin! I’ve never felt my skin so moisturized. It feels smoother, silkier, dare I say younger?! So as I sit here waiting to meet my public defender for my most recent charges of trespassing, indecent exposure (a ball slipped out….oops), interfering with official acts, and resisting arrest, I can’t help but say thank you, Biolage!

The directions state only use it for a minute or two, you're not going to get any effect from it in any great way with such little time. From day one, after the allergy test, I started using it on my entire head for at least 10 minutes. Since we're in quarantine I have all the time in the world so I did this three times each day. My hair to start with was basically 60% Gray, fully noticeable. At the end of day three using it three times a day 10 minutes each time the top of my head which is longer was basically finished and looked perfect. But the sides still had very noticeable greys and I have my sides cut very short. I remember my barber would always leave the hair dye on much longer than recommended. I decided to see what would happen if I started to use it only on my sides for 20 minutes at a time. Bingo after two days three times per day I have even color throughout. Now I can use the maintenance dosage when needed which would probably only be once every two or three days. I realize not everyone has the time to do this three times per day but at least leave it on longer for about 20 to 30 minutes in the beginning..the results will come quickly and then you can get to your maintenance ASAP without having to worry about the stubborn course greys.",2022-03-17 00:15:34.553116

We used it on a client yesterday and I wanted to share the results here, it’s incredible.  We left this on the clients hair for 5 minutes and the results speak for themselves.  There is no additional dye or toners etc used, just the shampoo onto wet hair!  Will buy more in for our customers for sure.  I’m not a review writer ever, but hope this helps someone get the results they would need on a budget!  But ladies it’s really strong, so read the instructions closely and step up the length of time you leave it on each time you use it, we left it on longer for another client and it went a lovely ash colour, very in trend.  Hope this helps anyone reading this:) a must try for sure!",2022-03-17 00:15:41.885424

I have light blonde hair (bleached) with platinum highlights throughout (UBER bleached) and try to keep it on the cooler side of blonde.  After reading all kinds of reviews I decided on this shampoo.  IT. DID. NOT. DISAPPOINT!!!  After reading lots of advice I prewashed with a clarifying shampoo, rinsed, donned some gloves and latered up with this shampoo.  I left it on for 3 minutes and rinsed.  WHOA!  Immediately I was able to see a difference.  I made sure to follow up with a moisturizing hair mask as this shampoo is very drying (was warned so wasn't surprised) and after towel then light blow dry was so happy with the result!  Cool blonde with platinum, REAL platinum highlights.  Just like I came from the salon!  I plan to do this about once every three weeks (I only wash once or twice a week) to keep up the results.

I think the bad reviews are from people using it on darker hair. I read the reviews and looked at the pictures and decided to try it out. So glad I did. I have relatively light blond hair but it’s very fine and as a result my hairdresser is reluctant to use a high volume bleach for fear of doing too much damage. This shampoo has elevated my blond hair to almost platinum which is exactly what I was going for. I left it on for around 2 mins. Roots went a little lilac so next time I’ll probably just use it to brighten the ends. It’s worked so well even my hairdresser wants the name of it! If you want a platinum blonde or brighter grey you must purchase this. Read the instructions and you can’t go wrong. Best purple shampoo I’ve used, and I’ve tried A LOT.

It is very strong so my advice to you is ""less is more"". What I mean is if you are using it for the first time and don't know how long to keep it on, choose the lesser time. For example, I left the product on for 3 minutes the first time. It definitely toned down the brassiness in my hair, but it wasn't quite the silver color I was trying to achieve. I waited a few days and a couple of shampoos later, I tried again and left it on for about 6 minutes and there was quite a bit of silver tone to it. So, it really depends on what color you are trying to achieve. I am trying to stay current with the silvery blonde look that seems to be in now. I am very happy with this product and I hope more people in the US find out about it. NOTE: The picture where I’m wearing the black sweatshirt is the before shot.

It has a very strong odor and can tend to make my fine hair frizzy.  It does work well but it's a little harsh and requires deep conditioning after using.  I use Redken shampoo and conditioner on a regular basis--it's the only brand I trust.  So, when I found this product, I immediately purchased it with the hope that I could replace the Neutrogena shampoo.  First, the name is a little misleading.  It is indeed a shampoo, not a cream.  The scent is very light and the shampoo lathers but doesn't feel harsh.  I also used Redken All Soft Mega Mask to condition after washing. When my hair dried, it was shiny, soft, bouncy and manageable. My scalp felt moisturized as well.  I could tell the build-up was gone because the color was lighter.  In conclusion, I had much better results than Neutrogena.  If you have fragile, fine hair I would highly recommend this product.  * P.S., I used this shampoo to prepare my hair for color treatment.  Wow! What a difference this makes! My hair took the color more evenly and it took the color to a  lighter shade, which is optimal. Hair is shiny and soft. I'm in love 😍",2022-03-17 00:17:04.681916

I actually bought it just based on reviews and I cannot believe how wonderful the scent it! I think I'm going to buy the conditioner as well because it smells divine and best of all your hair smells like this afterwards. I've gotten several compliments on smelling good since my couple of washes! Also, after my 1st wash my boyfriend asked if I lightened or did something to my hair! I couldn't believe that after one wash you could see such a difference. It definitely is a shampoo I won't use every wash just because it tones so much, but I'm really happy with the results. only con is that you have to use more shampoo per wash since it is sulfate free, but that is to be expected and doesn't bother me.

My hair is wavy caucasian hair and although I like hair care to be somewhat moisturizing and not stripping, this was FAR too greasy and heavy. I matched my hair type on their website to their suggestions and ordered this for me to use and for my teen daughter with loose curly hair. I wish I could give it 5 starts, because the ingredients are much safer than most other shampoos, but I can't because it is NOT good for typical caucasian hair in my opinion. People with dry curls may like it and it likely is great for those that want a REALLY HEAVY THICK moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it was so thick that my daughter's hair looked about 3 shades darker until she rewashed it with Acure (which we've used for the past few years).",2022-03-17 00:19:07.183702

I bought this product along with the corresponding conditioner upon recommendation from my hairstylist, and at first I thought it was a miracle, because it made my hair so soft and sleek. I was so excited, and spent $60 bucks on more of it after I used my first order. However- around the 6 month mark, I noticed my scalp was flaking more than usual. I chalked it up to winter weather, and ignored it - until I started noticing scabby patches appearing under my hair. I could not understand what was causing it, and tried discontinuing leave in conditioners, and changing pillowcases and diet- but nothing worked. The final straw was when my follicles started detaching: hair would drift down from my head in the middle of the day and I would see it on my shirts or in my car. It was awful- and then when I was reordering this shampoo, I noticed one of the one star reviews ALSO mentioned hair loss and dry scalp. I stopped using it and my scalp healed by the next week, and my hair loss has stopped over the last month. I switched to Garnier triple nutrition and that works way better with no irritation, and costs $7 at Target. So I would not recommend this- I spent $120 prolonging my hair recovery journey.",2022-03-17 00:19:42.009346

So, I got out a very bright light and a powerful magnifiying glass, and with the help of my husband we were able to determine that there is a warning on the bottle about using this product that can lead to health problems. The product should be tested on the skin 48 hours before each use, as a reaction could happen anytime it is used. They list a slew of ingredients, most of which sound like chemicals, but are unrecognizable to me. It is too late for me to send this back, but I am going to stop using this product at once.

The fragrance now has peach and musk added to the strawberry which makes it super strong and weird smelling and is NOT the mild strawberry it use to be. The reason they can legally say that the formula hasn't changed is because on the label, the fragrance change still gets to be on the label as ""fragrance."" That is the dishonest and misleading problem of my profession. So I am letting you know that the law allows them to say the formula hasn't changed, even though it has, because the LABEL hasn't changed. I have been trying to.get this law changed at the FDA, that just bc the label doesn't change doesn't mean they get to legally say the formula hasn't changed. It HAS changed!! If you change it you change it. So be warned, the CHEMICAL formula has definitely changed even though the LABEL formula has not. Don't be decieved.

It produces more sores and causes you to scratch your head like a crackhead. I wish I could give this product a .5 cause this definitely isn't for black hair or anyone's hair if we are being honest.

That being said it leaves my hair a little dry, but so does everything. It is the best shampoo I have used to date and the quality ingredients are actually healthy for your hair and promote hair growth. That being said it is not a product intended for hair loss, or to regrow hair. My hair is classified as 3C and is very dry. I have yet to find a shampoo that leaves my hair not feeling dry afterwards, but it is better than others I have tried in the past and I do like it. It kind of smells like a cross between vanilla extract and licorice with a hint of mint or something, good though. It's foamy and a little goes a long way. This bottle will last me forever as I only use it once and awhile. Overall, I prefer using a cowash (as I am coconut cowash-this stuff is awesome!) because of how dry my hair tends to be.

I am really surprised after using the product. Let me start by saying this bar smells fantastic! I got it in the mail and my entire kitchen was filled with the scent of this bar, it was great. The size of the bar is substaintle in comparison to many others too. However, on first use I knew it wasn't love. First it didn't seem to lather as well as some other brands I have used. So it took a lot of effort to get a good bubble going. I had noticed the insert with the bar talked about a transition period which I thought was a little weird because I hadn't experienced it with any other brand. My hair was SOOOOO dry and icky feeling. I hated it. But I stuck with it. I used this bar for a couple weeks before I finally threw it away and went back to a different brand. The last straw was when I realized the amount of build up on my scalp. I was finding that I could scratch my head and get soap build up under my fingernail. NO THANK YOU.",2022-03-17 00:26:51.869407

I really wanted to like this product, as it would be a cheaper alternative to the other natural stuff I get. The first time I washed my hair with it, I spent about an hour in the shower because I thought my hair was so greasy I kept needing more product. Turns out, the bar just leaves some sort of coating all over each hair that's completely impossible to wash out, unless maybe you have a different soap. Ironic. The residue looks like grease, leaving me with permanantly greasy looking hair, and it makes it take over an hour to brush out my thin, curly hair without ripping all of my hair out of my scalp (especially because the hair being sticky makes it catch and pull all hairs around it into tighter knots), and it then leaves a thin, white, sticky residue all over my brush.",2022-03-17 00:26:51.869407

It turned light brown but by the time I was thirty it was back to white.  I've tried several items to color my hair, over the years, not wanting white hair.  Most were messy, most didn't work very well, and so I decided I would have white hair.  But, I have a 10 year old daughter.  Shopping with her people would say, ""are you shopping with your grandfather today"" ?  So I thought I would try again with this shampoo reducing grey; I've never seen a shampoo style before.  This works, and I am so pleased with it.  I followed the instructions and used it four nights in a row, in the shower.  I have short hair so it doesn't take a lot to shampoo into my hair.  I immediately wash my hands after putting it into my hair, and finish washing, watching the clock.  The first night I didn't notice anything.  The second night I thought I could see a little color.  The third night I was sure I could see a very light brown.  The forth night my hair was very light brown, just the way I wanted it.  It was not messy to use.  The instructions say to dry with an older towel, which I did the first night.  But nothing came off onto the towel, so I  just dry with my regular towel now.  I do rinse very well, again, in the shower.  It would be difficult to rinse that well in a bath tub.  The top of my head is a little darker than the sides, probably from the way I apply it.  This makes it look very natural in that every hair is not the exact same color.  I'm very pleased with this product.  It is easy to use, it doesn't get all over everything (like some things I have tried) and the price is reasonable.  My plan is to use it once a week, to keep the roots from coming in white.  I will adjust my usage as needed.  I wrote this review to help you see that this product is different, easy to use, and might be what you have been looking for, as it was with me.  I didn't have any chemical reaction to this product, but be sure to do the test the product recommends.",2022-03-17 00:29:04.962134

I'm mid-60s and have been totally grey for a number of years. In fact, it's been trending more towards white these last few years. I didn't suddenly want a headfull of brown hair. What I was hoping for was a look that was age appropriate. Something that toned down the old man look that I saw in the mirror. I tried this product right after getting my haircut. I have them use a number 4 blade on the sides and back (so pretty short) and then leave an inch and a half on top. I used this every morning when I showered, putting a portion about the size of a quarter in my palm and massaging it in with my palms. I then left it in for about two minutes before rinsing it out. After that I applied a conditioner and then rinsed that as well. I didn't notice anything different for the first few days. It was day four when I first saw some slight darkening. Now, after day eight, it is to the point where I would call it a golden grey, if that makes any sense. The white is totally gone and it's sort of a deep grey color with blonde highlights. I actually like the look. It doesn't look at all dyed or fake and seems totally age appropriate. Years back I tried the typical out of the box dye, and this is a much more natural look. Now the challenge will be how to proceed in maintenence mode to maintain the look. My only regret is that I didn't try this sooner. Great product! One note: I did have a small amount of fingernail staining. Not so bad that anyone would notice though. After both massaging it in and rinsing it I would wash my hands, but a little staining still occurred.",2022-03-17 00:29:04.962134

I use the lighter brown, mind you, so I've had no problems with staining the white tiles in the bathroom.  A couple notes:  Don't use white/light colored towels to dry yourself because you will get some slight staining.  I use old junk towels.  Also, if you want it to work better or faster, leave it on for about 2 minutes or more.  I use it only once a week (or right after a haircut) and leave it on for 2 minutes near the end of the shower and that's all that is needed.  There's a version with conditioner that is great also if you have dry hair. Enjoy.",2022-03-17 00:29:04.962134

To begin with, it has a new and too strong smell of mint, completely different from the mild and pleasant smell the original formula used to have. And it stays with you, no matter how you treat you hair after the shampoo. It has a sting sensation to the scalp that is just annoying and doesn't help if you are used to keep it on the scalp for a few minutes before rinsing to maximize the benefits. Right, the benefits: none. Gone, completely. This new formula is so aggressive that it strips the hair of their natural hydration and defenses, leaving the hair not just flat and dull but actually damaged.

Hair loss will stop, then your hair will begin to get thicker.  You will start to see new hair coming in.  Give it a try!  I would also use an oral supplement that is an herbal vitamin and a ""DHT blocker"" .  These are available from many different manufacturers and prices.

Before I started using the product, I started noticing a lot of hair falling out in the shower and my hair getting much thinner at my hair-line (for context I'm in my late-20's, so this was starting to concern me). My barber recommended Zenagen for Men because the chemicals they use are supposed to be healthier and her customers reported good results. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and started using it at least twice a week. By month three I noticed new hairs growing right at my hair-line. By month 6, I noticed significantly less hair coming out each time I showered. Now at month 10, I'm not even worried about hair loss anymore. My results have convinced my Dad to start using it and he is currently 2 months in. Consistency is key, so for the sake of maintaining the health of my hair, I'll be using this from now on. The shampoo smells good and when coupled with the conditioner makes my hair feel and smell great. I definitely recommend anyone experiencing hair loss to try this product.

My hairdresser recommended getting shampoo with tea tree oil in it and that was sulfate free and recommended shampooing my hair about half the time. I started googling shampoos and I found this one. I am not one to believe in spending a lot of money on hair products, so I was more than please with this price. When I tried it though, I couldn't believe how amazing it was! It didn't lather great the first time, but after letting it sit for about 2 minutes then rinsing, I scrubbed again and it lathered amazingly! I also let that round sit for about another 2 minutes and rinsed. My hair had never felt so clean after shampooing. Ever! I also let the conditioner sit for about 2 minutes then rinsed. The shampoo wasn't the best smelling shampoo I have ever tried, but the conditioner smells great! I love how it makes my hair feel and smell! And most of all, no more itching, flakes, or bumps!

You must keep it in for at least five minutes so I shampoo first and wait while I wash the rest of me, then rinse out thoroughly.  You don’t need a whole lot of shampoo, just a small dollop, and it’s really a dark green-black color that suds up to a gray green in your hair. Careful not to get it in your eyes - First time using I bent my head down while bathing and suds burned in my eye so now I’m more careful. It has a not unpleasant scent but not my favorite. Does feel like it adds volume to my hair and seems to work pretty well for me. Was a really good price online!

I get greasy roots, and my ends are very dry and prone to breakage. That being said, I bought this bar shampoo back in September 2021 and have been using it exclusively for at least the last 3 months ( I tried to use up my bottles first so I didn’t start using this exclusively until around November 2021). I start at the roots and suds up my scalp and then squeeze the suds down to the ends of my hair. I rinse and then repeat doing the scalp again due to my oily scalp. This gets my hair super clean and I don’t have to use conditioner except a small amount of leave in on the ends.Sometimes, I don’t even need the leave in conditioner if I am not too vigorous with the lathering.  The bar is still going strong as of January 22, 2022. I shampoo my hair about 2-3 times a week this way due to the length of my hair and the dry ends. The bar lasts a long time. It smells wonderful like honey. It lathers well and my hair doesn’t feel too tangled unlike with regular shampoo and even conditioners.  I saw Drew Barrymore’s Instagram post showing her hair, which appears to be similar to mine in length and texture.  I thought I would try it.  I was very surprised.  If it helps cut down on plastic, cleans my hair and smells good, it’s a win-win.  One thing, when ordering from Amazon they ship it in a big oversized bubble wrap plastic envelope mailer.  That kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging that the bar comes in.  Next time I will see if I can find it in the store.",2022-03-17 00:38:47.524832

I recently let my hair go naturally silver.  It is a beautiful color and I wanted to make sure that it was shiny as it could possibly be. I have a bottle of Clairol Shimmer lights, the purple shampoo for silver hair and another shampoo by Clairol that is supposed to help with yellowing in silver hair. These shampoos are okay but they kind of leave a purplish cast to the very white parts of my hair. I don't like that so the only time I really use one of these purple shampoos is if I've gotten a lot of yellow in my hair due to being outside in the sun or swimming.  NOW LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ""White Hot shampoo!  It is wonderful wonderful wonderful. My hair is so shiny and so pretty seriously. I never say this about my hair. My hair is on the fine side even though it is silver it is not really course at all. The white hot shampoo seems to to be perfect for my hair. I let my hair dry naturally because it is short and I rub through just a little amount of Josey Maran Argan butter and I mean a very little amount let my hair dry naturally. I always wash it in the evening so the next day while I'm getting ready I just run some water through it let it dry add a few foam curlers to the top. Take the curlers out run my fingers through my hair fluff it a bit and add some either Cheapo TRESemme hairspray or a little bit of Styling cream.  And BAM!!!! it looks good.  I also like to wash my hair with a clarifying shampoo every couple of weeks I added some of the white hot shampoo to my Aveda Rosemary mint clarifying shampoo and I love it for clarifying hair. Also the shampoo goes a long long way. I love love love it I never write reviews believe me",2022-03-17 00:47:23.946687

She said it was best on extensions and full lace wigs. I have a full lace that needed a little extra care because it has aged. I ordered and bought this product. I never put any product directly on the hair. I washed it, and the hair was not as silky as she said. It was tangled and course like. When I use regular shampoo it still had a silky texture and waved up. So I said the magic must be in the conditioner. When conditioning, it did not make a difference. After the full lace wigs dried, the smell was horrific. It is a super strong perfume smell. When I applied the wig, I had to take it off within 20 minutes because the scent was unbearable. I tried two times, each time airing out the hair hoping that it will die down. A week later and the scent was just as strong. On the finally day, I took my trusty Dawn dish detergent, because it strips anything (praying the entire time because the wig was 300 bucks), to strip the smell. It worked and my wig is back to normal. Can you imagine if I put it on my hair? I returned it immediately. UPDATE! The wig dried and the super perfume still remained. I could smell it wet. I have put it in a netted bag and put it in washing machine with Tide oxi. If that doesn't work, I will try baking soda. What type of chemical is this? Finally....I had to throw away full lace wigs.

After a few washes my hair became dull and I knew better than to keep dying it, so I did my research. After a few videos and feedback I decided to order this set of the shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner and let me tell you! Right after my shower I went into my kitchen (that has just an ordinary in-door lighting to it), and my cousin immediately noticed a difference. I didn't tell her about getting this product or anything, and when she saw me she thought I had died my hair again!

After the 4th wash it was worse, plus I had a strange feeling of build up weighing down my roots along with the dry, rough ends. I think, though the claim is the ingredients are natural, the protein builds up and causes the rough texture, and the sulfates are drying. For a color care shampoo, the sulfates were surprising, as were the lack of moisturizing ingredients. And, lastly, the scent. Definitely strong, overpowering, sweet but...milky? Some said they got vanilla. I'm a fan of all things vanilla and this wasn't it. Ultimately I returned the shampoo, conditioner, and the incredible milk. Just not for me.",2022-03-17 00:50:22.313868

I typically blow dry my hair (because every guy should) and saw more hair falling out. I didn’t actually see it falling out but when I would put product in my hair, I would see around 6-7 pieces of hair on my hand after. Normally I would see maybe 2 after applying product. Also, after showering, I would notice a lot of my hair around the drain and was worried. This shampoo was the only thing I changed during that time and I’ve stopped using it. My hair is very thick to begin with but I could tell it was definitely thinner and felt as if it just had a hair cut. Mind you male pattern baldness does not run in my family nor mothers and my fathers hair is like a helmet which does not thin, only turns grey. I digress. Do not buy this shampoo.

We will never go back. I have of course seen all the reviews with people complaining about the mesh bag. I am personally in the beginning stages of going waste free so, duly noted to all you hardcore waste free folks. As far as the mesh bag... I’ll recycle the friggin thing. So no matter which way you slice it, it’s less material than a bottle of shampoo, a water bottle, etc. That said, I love these. It lathers well, is gentle enough for my children, the scents are lovely, and everyone in the houses hair is softer, and shinier. My husband and I both had issues with flaking and dandruff, and that has STOPPED completely. Which is amazing because I have been trying for YEARS to find an organic/vegan product to combat this with no luck. I’m a big fan, and I’ll continue to order, and I’ll continue to recycle the mesh bag, as well as the packaging box. My apologies to those that are soooo upset about the mesh bag, paper box, and the sticker that is on the wrapper of the bar (like... really?), but I’m giving 5 stars for the product itself, not it’s packaging. Just read the description of the different benefits of the varying scents. I have the honey, rosemary (for shine and moisture) and the cinnamon, and ginger (for hair growth). I have noticed faster growth in my hair, and certainly more shine. My only suggestion would be for the company to give the option of the mesh bag for repeat customers. But other than that, it’s certainly an affordable and great product for those starting out on a waste free journey, and wanting to have healthy hair in the process.",2022-03-17 01:19:39.222949

I could not detangle my hair while the product was in my hair so I started to wash it out and hoped that as I brushed it during this step then my hair would detangle. If I’m being generous then maybe it worked on a 1/2 inch of my hair in some parts. I washed it out and noticed my hair felt really dry.

I can't say for sure whether it works with regard to lice.  I haven't yet used it for preventive purposes.  However, when I found I had lice, I did some home remedies first, then combed out my hair thoroughly, and then used this shampoo once I received it a couple of days later.  I did get rid of the lice/nits within 7 days or so, but I did a lot of combing during that time.  Still, I have a hunch this shampoo contributed to me not getting the lice back since there were probably nits lying around on clothes and furniture (I had the itching for a few weeks before realizing what it was).  And having long hair, it's hard to do a really thorough combing job, so it's nice to have the shampoo as reinforcement in the lice eradication effort.",2022-03-17 01:33:30.843632

It's my favorite, by a long, long mile. Here are the reasons why:  1. It is not a castile or oil bar, it is actually a syndet bar, so it actually cleans your hair, especially important if you have hard water.  2. It's solid, and doesn't threaten to crumble like a lot of the really popular brands.  3. The smell is intense, yes, but it doesn't overpower once you've rinsed. 4. It's not drying, like some of the puck-looking varieties. Yes, you need a conditioner after, but don't you usually need one anyway?  5. The heart shape is actually really easy to grip - it's the only one I haven't dropped by accident!  6. It really lathers; protip: don't try to lather up your hands, then transfer to your head and expect that to work. Run the bar directly through your hair and work it up that way.",2022-03-17 01:33:54.136756

I prefer tropical flowers over rose garden types. I opened the box and immediately thought I was going to struggle with the scent. I gave it a try though and was pleasantly surprised after a few uses. At first thought, I loved the shape and feel of this bar. It’s easy to grip and seems to hold up fairly well. The soapy feel threw me off a bit. It also seemed to be less moisturizing than my LUSH bar. But, after a few times using this, my hair felt so light and my layers were pretty happy with it. The scent faded away and doesn’t bother me at all anymore. I love this product. I still mix it up with my LUSH one when I want to add more moisture to my hair vs. airy/soft feeling.

The scent was strong when I first took it out of the box, however when I lathered it up and actually washed my hair the scent was a lot more subtle. I usually wash my hair with shampoo twice every shower so the first wash I didn’t notice much of a lather, however after I rinsed it out and did my second wash I noticed a big improvement. I didn’t use conditioner because I wanted to see what the shampoo would do on it’s own, so I just brushed  out a few tangles and went to bed.

However, I've had luck with Argon Oil products in the past to help repair my very fine, thin hair, which is extremely oily at the root and extremely dry at the ends.  I realized I needed a moisture shampoo (since I now live in the desert, and the dry climate makes my hair looks absolutely fried).  It has also had a lot of processing done to it, but every ""repair"" or ""moisture"" shampoo I try is WAY too heavy for my fine hair, weighs it down, and never cleans my oil-slick roots well.  Desperately, I turned to this product because of the reviews, the sulfate-free description (my hair is color treated), and my past success with Argon Oil.  I am, quite frankly, amazed at how good it is.  I expected another shampoo-turned-hand soap situation.  This stuff actually cleans my roots, while imparting lightweight moisture and shine to the rest of my hair.  It has truly helped rebalance my scalp and repair my fried ends.  Because it cleanses without overdrying, my roots now produce less oil to compensate, and I can go longer without washing my hair (which is also better for its health).  This is one of the ONLY shampoos I have ever tried that can do this.  I attribute this to the inclusion of Argon and essential oils, which have amazing lightweight yet deep moisture properties (without heaviness or greasiness) if balanced well with other ingredients.  This was a very random, but very fortunate,  product encounter for me.  I highly recommend trying this (and for less than $15 a pop, this is a bargain compared to ""high-end"" shampoos...which this Arvazallia outperforms anyway, at least for my hair type).",2022-03-17 01:36:10.322845

If you're looking for a good shampoo for dry hair I'd recommend Amika's Velveteen Dream shampoo.  It's expensive but worth it.  Don't waste your money on this shampoo.",2022-03-17 01:36:10.322845

Overall I’m very happy with the color it gave me. I’ve used it probably 2-3 times a weeks since September, 2020. It’s December, 2020 now & I still have a bit left. A little bit goes along way. The sent is also very light and sweet.",2022-03-17 01:39:21.919503

It colors the light parts of my hair and leaves the dark alone like a glaze would do. The pictures show using only the shampoo and using it 2 showers in a row and leaving it in for the top 5 mins it recommends and then washing with regular shampoo the 3rd wash (bc it got too dark for my liking when I did 3 shampoos in a row).

Leftover tangles fall lose, my hair sighs, I couldn't have been more surprised if Fabio entered my bathroom and messaged this shampoo in himself. I cannot explain the sheer bliss after 15 years of merely acceptable auditions culminating in a shampoo to swoon over. As for the price I admit I was scared, but how much the average person pays for barely acceptable products who's makers care little to nothing about their Impact on intended users or the environment where they were sourced. Your paying for a product that works beyond belief and if you want beyond belief results you have to support the brands giving you the results, it cost money to source ingredients at this high a level.

It's clean. After it's dry, my hair feels soft and bouncy - yes, bouncy, which seems impossible to achieve with natural shampoo. It curls better now than it has in months.

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I often use Dove shampoo. I try to mix it up frequently as I'm always trying new products, but Dove is one of my favorite non-salon type shampoos. This is no exception. It feels luxurious and smells great. I never have any irritation. My hair always feels and looks clean, shiny, bouncy and manageable.  It is a very moisturizing product. I don't do a lot with my hair as in heat-treatment, coloring, blow drying or styling, so I can't speak to how well it works with all the abuse.  I like that it is consistent in quality and always makes my hair and scalp feel good. Lingering scent which I love!

I can't speak as to the Ylang-Ylang, as I've never smelled it before. Although I did Google Ylang-Ylang. Apparently -that- is used in perfumes.

I was able to go to bed that night without itching.  I've been using it for every shower and it has made a huge difference.  As I've aged, my skin has grown dryer and dryer, and this is even helping with keeping my hands moisturized during the day.  It comes out like baby oil (without making the tub slippery), and I had initially used it with a washcloth, but that seems to impede the ability to spread it around.  Use it without a washcloth and it spreads better.  Again, does not make the shower/tub slippery.

In 2014, he had a major skin breakout that took us several doctor visits to diagnose.  Two doctors diagnosed him with eczema and referred us to a specialist.  The physicians were adamant that skin conditions are extremely hard to treat.  They wanted us to realize that this would not be easy.  The doctor gave us samples of two products.  One sample was this product and the other was Aquaphor Baby Wash & Shampoo.  We use the Eucerin in the bath water and the Aquaphor to wash our munchkin.  It worked! No pricey specialist, medications, or creams.  This did the trick and has work for years.  When the weather changes and we have more severe flair ups we use CeraVe Moisturizing Cream.  The doctor will sometimes prescribe a prescription steroid to mix with it.  These three things have been life savers for our little boy.  Skin conditions are tough to treat. Medications and treatment can be extremely expensive and often yield no benefit.  This is a review from a mom that these products work.  Yes, the Eucerin is oily.  It's an oil to moisturize the skin.  No, we have not ever had problems with it smelling, but I guess that's more of an individual biased.  That said, it doesn't have a bad smell or a great smell.

As a vegan I was very happy because this soap uses no animal products, and the company doesn’t test on animals.  Unfortunately the two most recent purchases I made resulted in a very watered-down soap. I mean, it was so noticeable a change in texture that it leaves little doubt to me that someone, or the company itself, has cut the formula with a significant amount of water. The first time I thought it was a one-off problem, but my most recent purchase was just as watery.",2022-03-17 02:27:23.484705

Also this is the third time I have received it leaking all over the place This time, as shown in the picture, it is about 1/4th gone. At least this time they sealed it in plastic wrap so it wasn't leaking through the box.  After this delivery I looked at some other reviews and found some long-time users are experiencing the same issues. Until the company fixes this I am done with this product. Too bad because I have eczema and it has been a nice smelling body wash that didn't burn my skin. But it's a waste of money to have a product half gone and all water!!",2022-03-17 02:27:23.484705

If your skin feels oily and dirty or sticky....wash with this! Does a fantastic job! I used to use Nubian but they sold out to a large company and changed all the formula's which make it HORRIBLE.

The first ingredient is NEEM which for avid planthusiasts, is a necessity for fighting off pests that arise. The fact is also, neem oil is best used when you mix it with some sort of soap to help it bind together to spray on your leaves. I was desperate one day to clean my dusty leaves and figured that this organic formula is actually PERFECT as long as you dilute the soap with lots of water. I used one tiny pump with lots water and mixed it in a spray bottle onto a microfiber cloth. This concoction worked BEAUTIFULLY for getting the job done and I haven’t gotten any pests since then. My leaves are so shiny and beautiful and since taking off that layer of dust on them, they have been growing faster as there’s nothing impeding them from  receiving ample light. I do believe the original version is best for this HACK since we don’t know how the essential oils on the other options are going to react to your plants. As far as a body cleanser, it is nice however I still prefer something with SLS from time to time to get rid of grime and a little funk from the underarms. I usually have something strictly for those CREVASSES (play on words thanks to Tenacious D, IYKYK). Hope this helps y’all!",2022-03-17 02:43:09.905762

If today's buyer looks at the ingredients shown on the product, ""water"" appears first on the list.

I also compared it to a small travel-sized bottle I got last month. The travel bottle is the old familiar formula. Did I just get a bad batch? Are there quality control issues with multiple manufactures, or has the formula actually changed? I really hope not! I just looked at the recent reviews on Amazon and I now see that I am not the only one who has noticed this. While the new bottle is not unpleasant, it is not what I hoped for.

Glad I found it because my itchiness is gone and it barely leaves any scent. (I haven’t been able to enjoy scented products since I had morning sickness so I usually buy unscented.) The pump is convenient, it’s fully shrink-wrapped when shipped, and the large size means I don’t have to replace it as often.

Smithe,,Verified Purchase,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"As a body wash this is really enjoyable. It doesn't seem to have a pleasant scent til you start using it. When you're rubbing it into your skin that's when you'll really start to notice the scent, and its a nice one but subtle and light. This makes a very rich lather. Which means you can use less and still cover your entire body. My skin didn't feel dry or stripped after having used this. The price has me hanging back a bit, however. After using this, and asking my husband and son their thoughts after they used it as well, none of us would've guessed it costs as much as it does (currently 22 bucks for a tube).",2022-03-17 03:02:03.583378

And I have no great complaints about it - it seems like a perfectly fine body wash - but I’m not understanding what about it is supposed to command such a high price. It has a mild citrus scent which is reasonably nice. And it doesn’t dry out my skin. It supposedly contains antioxidants, which I guess might help with something but it would take a long scientific trial to figure out if that’s so. And it seems to do a fine job of cleaning despite being low-lather. If there’s something specific about this product that sounds really appealing to you, then by all means go for it. It’s a perfectly fine body wash, and everyone is going to have different preferences. It just doesn’t stand out as anything that special to me so I find no particular reason to recommend it over any other option. If I have an epiphany as I work my way through the rest of the tube, then I’ll update this review.

It has coffee extract but don't worry, you won't smell like coffee beans after using this product. I couldn't really smell it. The scent is quite light, not at all overpowering or overwhelming. This body cleanser is more of a runny liquid, you can actually hear it when you shake the tube. I had to be careful when I was dispensing it from the tube as I didn't want to waste too much product. Terre de Mars products are on the higher end in terms of price, but not unreasonable. I know not everyone wants to spend over $20 for a body wash but if you can splurge a little I would recommend giving this brand a try. Their products are good quality, gender neutral, cruelty free, vegan, and the brand as a whole seem to care about the environment.

It’s not what you’d expect from an authentic African black soap. The product is made of African mint and the co-founder’s husband is African.  There isn’t mint in authentic African black soap. Neither does this product contain plantain like the authentic. The product is very drying for the skin. It’s a must to oil and lotion immediately after bathing/showering. If you don’t, you will regret it. No sitting around to air dry. That goes for Black people as well as non-Black people. My family was perfect for testing this product. Unlikely to buy again.

All from the same company.. i got; a bar of facial soap, body wash, shampoo n conditioner and body lotion.. i apply the body lotion after my shower and I don’t  even put the medication on til later in the day after the lotion has had some time to settle in. This combination of stuff has cleared me up 4 days. Nothing else I did prior has done this. Highly recommend",2022-03-17 03:07:34.409314

I would suggest smelling tea tree before ordering this soap, then considering if you actually want your soap to smell like that.  I give it 5 stars based on the thickness, packaging, and smell.  I like tea tree oil smell.  I bought this soap because I needed translucent soap for my eyebrows (I want to make them look thicker).  I have very delicate skin and I usually use tea tree oil for it, so I figured this soap should work well with my skin.  So far it hasn’t made me break out.",2022-03-17 03:07:34.409314

Sometimes, those chances don't pay off and this is one of those times. I did't find this to be moisturizing at all and is one of the biggest reason I switched to a body wash because my body is so dry. This didn't help in the least. And as for the scent, I'm not in love with it. I previously used a department store brand body sugar and matching body wash and wanted to narrow down from two bottles to one in my shower and thought this was the answer. This scent is not better and if anything, worse than the one I was using from the department store. No fascinating scent that hangs around all day and a little cheap smelling to me. My husband hasn't noticed a change when he hugs me unlike the amazing smell he has when he uses his pricey body wash. As for the value, my two products cost half of this bottle and I'll agree with everyone else, without a pump, it's useless!!! I found a pump from another product that works but I'm not getting a foamy result.

My hot water has run out of my shower and my need to try this skincare line is no more. It’s a shame. I really wanted it to work. I wish I could say something worked. Well the pump worked to get the product out. I’m just grateful I didn’t order any other products and wanted more money.,2022-03-17 03:15:48.478582

I was getting a little worried when I saw all the negative comments regarding the scent. But I have to say they were pretty over dramatic. The scent really isn't that strong or bad. I understand if you are extremely sensitive, then maybe. But some of the reviews were people saying they were not sensitive and could barely handle the smell. The soap literally has bits of seaweed in it, so it does have an odd smell. But it certainly had no affect on my opinion of the product because so far my skin is loving it. Probably not strong enough by itself to combat acne- but I bought several other products form this line for that. This is a great cleanser for everyday use for those of us who are sensitive to acne medications. I have used this every morning and evening since my purchase, and my skin has had zero bad effects. Which is huge for me regarding skincare. Definitely worth giving it a try if you're considering this buy.

My rosacea is improving now after using this combination and my face definitely feels squeaky clean after using the face wash. There’s a lot to learn about rosacea and any skin sensitivity, so I encourage anyone struggling with it to read some forums and just try the simpler suggestions first like quitting milk/sugar and keeping your face cool before you resort to potentially expensive prescriptions.

It worked wonders, that first day he was able to get so much of the grease stain off of his fingers that they were almost normal colored again.  Now he uses it everyday and the only places he has black on his fingers or knuckles is in the cracks too deep for the soap to get into.  It also works great for me after gardening and does not dry out my skin.  The soap is in an oversized bar that seems to be lasting extremely well.  We have only been using it for a few weeks, but so far it seems to be about the same size as when I opened the package.  It has a delightful peppermint scent that you can smell as soon as you enter our bathroom.  It does have some grainy texture to it when lathered up, but it is not near as rough as Lava soap.

To be completely honest, in times past, I would never purchase Olay products because of the cost.  However; when I learned of its quality and results, I could no longer place a price on the well being of my skin.  Many, if not all soap bars have lye and provides less moisture and hydration for my skin, so I’ve fallen in love with body washes.  True story: I was born and reared in Palm Beach County and lived five minutes from the Atlantic Ocean.  If we got a scrape or cut, we’d jump in the ocean to help heal it. Perhaps I’m old fashioned but I still believe in nature having its own medicinal power to heal and cure.  Many folks take sea kelp as a dietary supplement for the many health benefits it’s purported to have.  For the skin, it has been shown to moisture and hydrate dry skin because of the the antioxidants and minerals it contains.  It also softens skin and removes toxin.  My skin is shiny, smells great, moisturized and much softer after each use and I plan to continue purchasing this body wash with sea kelp.

I went to Ulta to try and find something, I was desperate. I searched for about an hour for something. I stumbled over this product, read what it's benefits were and decided to take a chance! I couldn't be happier with it and I don't plan on switching to anything else. The price on AMZN is much cheaper than in store..",2022-03-17 03:37:45.857146

The lipstick itself has a nice buttery feel when applied but there is simply not enough pigment in these lipsticks to make them look on the lips the same color as they appear in the tube. Even a straightforward classic red only registers light pink on the lips and when tested on my hand. Some barely register a color. Probably better to spend money on a single tube of lipstick you know you love rather than buy a set of 12 that are just so-so and indistinct. That said, if you like very sheer lipsticks you may like this, but just know that rather than 12 distinct shades, its more like 4-5 shades with very incremental differences between them.",2022-03-17 04:09:27.129548

Occasional application is needed, but not any more frequent than any other drugstore lipstick. The only things I don't like about these lipsticks are the packaging and the transfer.

Why you ask?  Because not all red lipsticks are equal.  Some make your teeth look yellow like a toxic substance, others are unflattering to your skin tone and then a lot of them are drying or bleed or smear all over your face.  I know I can put this lipstick on in the morning (even though I'm not going anywhere I still wear it - strictly for me) and it will still look good before I take it off at night.  So it lasts through lunch, dinner, a snack or 2 and several coffees, pops, waters and tea.  If I eat something that has some oil in it the inner part of my lips might need a touch up but normally I don't touch it all day.  It makes me look better with it than I look without it.  Even my adult son who mostly hates the look of lipsticks on anyone has complimented me on this lipstick.  I think his exact words were - 'nice lipstick'!  That's as good a compliment as I've ever gotten.  I will keep this one in stock.",2022-03-17 04:24:52.487018

        TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"Yes, this lipstick is super pricey. But it’s Tatcha and that is to be expected. This lipstick is not just for anyone though. This is for the makeup lover who is looking for a quality formula paired with a luxurious experience. From the moment I slide open the box, the experience began. The design of the component is simple and classy. The detailed gold embellishments take the bullet to the next level making it feel a little regal. The beveling on the lipstick itself is exquisite. But all of that is just the visual experience. Once you pick this precious baby up, it lets you know right away just how expensive it is. This lipstick is weighted. WEIGHTED. The heaviest lipstick I own. I’m not joking when I say that you could send someone to the hospital if you threw this lipstick at their head. It’s like a roll of quarters. The majority of the weight is in the cap, so applying it to the lips isn’t a total workout. But the weight is for sure the stand out with this lipstick. I can literally feel how high quality this product is with just my hands. That being said, the formula is really nice as well. This lipstick delivers in every way. I found the lipstick to glide on smoothly and have a silky texture. Not too thick, not sticky, not streaky, nothing bad. It wears down evenly throughout the day. It’s moisturizing and very comfortable. It has a satin sheen with a subtle shimmer. Just a lovely lipstick that looks natural and very pretty. I can either use a thin layer for a “my lips but better” look or I can apply a full layer and have a beautiful soft pink moment. Either way, this lipstick looks great and is the perfect shade for everyday. I ordered it in “Cherry Blossom”, and I would describe the color as a dainty tea rose pink. It’s not too warm toned and not too cool toned. Just a really nice pink. I don’t think anyone would be disappointed with this lipstick. You get what you pay for with this one. And what you get is pure LUXURY. I highly recommend this lipstick to all the luxury makeup lovers out there. This one checks all of the boxes, I promise!",2022-03-17 04:30:14.339137

I do not like Sedona Sands so much, as it is a little dull and you can hardly see any lipstick on, it is kind of mauve/beige, no red. I do not like Carolina Coast at all, it is a weird plastic pink (best way I can describe it), not the kind of translucent pearly pink I was looking for.

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I was excited to get this lip stain set as I had read good reviews about it.  It comes with six different colors with unusual scientific names such as:  Beakers, Vials, Flasks, Condensers, Distillation, and Test Tubes.  They arrived in a plastic bag and were each in their own little box.  The bottles inside are cute little nipple top bottles, but the top is not a squeezable dropper type.  The applicator wand inside(attached to top), is just the right size with an angled sponge tip.  I found it very easy to apply with precision.  I tested all colors on my hand, and the color Flasks on my lips.  It didn't say how long it takes to dry, so I gave it a good 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes I applied water(as it said it was ""waterproof""), and smeared it a little.  There was some bleeding of color, but after wiping off the excess that bled, there was still a substantial stain left.  I did the ""blot test"" on a tissue and only a small amount of color came off my lips.  When I tested it by drinking from a straw, there was no transfer at all of color.  I even licked my lips a few times and ate something and most of the stain remained on my lips.  I even used soap and water on the colors on my hand, and five out of the six colors remained.  I am VERY PLEASED with this lip stain set.  It has beautiful long lasting colors at a VERY REASONABLE price!",2022-03-17 05:04:52.054672

        VINE VOICE",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,I’m actually pretty impressed with this liquid lipstick. I didn’t know what to expect since it said it was and also waterproof. It arrived super fast. Each lip stick is packaged individually and the packaging is really cute. They look like little droppers but the bottle is glass the top is not silicone it’s like a hard plastic. As you apply those it feels liquidy and creamy and a little thick. But it doesn’t take long for it to dry down. It is true to color and it doesn’t dry down to that hard dry grainy feeling like other matte lipsticks do. It’s almost like a stain. It is for sure waterproof and I could hardly get it off with soap and water. I really like the set I like the variety of colors and I would definitely recommend it.,2022-03-17 05:04:52.054672

The applicator is a long, oval spongy tip like most doe foot applicators for liquid lipsticks. The stain is hard for me to apply evenly. I can grab a tube of lipstick and apply evenly with a refined edge in a second, whereas this liquid lipstick goes on thick in some areas and thin in others. Once I get it smoothed out evenly and it has dried, it is okay, but it's more like a stain. My dry lips are soon begging for some kind of soothing layer to keep them moisturized. That pretty well defeats all the effort I made. So, for me, these are worth 2.5 stars at best.",2022-03-17 05:04:52.054672

It was supposed to be more red but it came out orangey red when lightly applied. I am not mad about that. If u want the shade Bright red & you are expecting a bold red then you probably shouldn’t get this one and maybe try Coy or any of the deeper red. Shade: Bright red. I would recommend mixing this shade with Peripera Ink airy velvet lip tint in shade 04 Pretty pink. They pair together well, and the only con to this lip is the easy removal. It stays if you dont eat, drink, wipe mouth even lightly, and stuff like that. Besides that this is really cute and I like the bottle",2022-03-17 05:11:38.206760

The colors are good neutral shades, as well... I have at least 5 shades that are good on me depending on the look I want. I usually line outside with a slightly darker color for defined look and then immediately swipe a coordinating paler color on central lip, blending with my finger before it sets.

It’s like a happy medium between a lip tint and a lip stick. It’s moisturizing like a balm, but with more color. It doesn’t last super long, especially when eating or drinking, but I don’t mind.

Highly recommend if you’re looking to brighten up your lips without being overly dramatic.

The Fancy Rose (200) shade is straight up brown.  I’m not sure how they get rose because there is nothing rose toned about it. Think 90’s grunge brown lipstick and this is it.  It is very pigmented and leans warm. The Berry Lit (240) shade is very pigmented and vibrant with a dark pink cool undertone.  This color is actually very pretty although it is a little too bold for me. The formula of these is not my favorite.  I was hoping this worked like a lip stain and it does tint the lips slightly but just not enough for me.  It’s not the most comfortable lip tint but it does have decent lasting power.  My biggest critique is the packaging and application.  I hate these sponge tip applicators.  It seems very unsanitary and it’s hard to tell when you have released enough product without going way overboard.  The shades are vibrant and pigments, but not very flattering on me.  The ones I’ve tried either lean very cool or very warm whereas I generally prefer a more neutral/nude shade for day to day wear.  Overall, I would just say this formula is ok.  Not the best but not the worst.  I much prefer The Balm Jour lip stains for daily wear.",2022-03-17 05:26:07.173713

I bought pink IRL and this shade is actually lighter than my natural lip color so it barely shows up so I get a light pink color. I don't get that nice blotted pink look. The spongy applicator is strange to use and I'm not a fan. I prefer using a traditional applicator and rubbing the product around. The sponge seems to soak it up and waste it. The formula itself is okay. Not too moisturizing nor too drying. Not bad but nothing I'd buy again.

Last night I tried a new color and fell asleep with it on, woke up and looked like I just applied it. I have 6 different colors so far. I'll never buy anything else.",2022-03-17 05:32:27.065972

The design is awesome. The profile is slim smooth and sleek. Almost reflects a laptop style shape size etc. Picture is great looking, EXCEPT for some reason there is a ton of lines through the screen. The company asked for pictures and only reply in middle of the night, probably replying from China.  They asked me to return but that is not possible at this time. I waited over a month for the installer to get to my project. Between the screen and the custom install i have about a 1,000.00 wrapped into this overhead monitor.  So i was advised to return and repurchase. Waiting a month to get the installer to remove and then another month with holes in my roof and dangling wires is not what I would expect from XTRONS especially since i bought their highest priced monitor from them. Save your time and money before installing this custom piece into your vehicle. Not worth the hassle. EDIT 10-12-2020 - Due to COVID I was unable to have the shop replace my unit for they faulty one in a timely manner. Xtrons said i can have the old one repaired but i can not return the item since i went past the 30 days. OR i can return it for an 80% refund.

I feel like most of the brands out there are all the same for the most part.  This set looks absolutely GREAT and when installed right look to be factory.  My issue is with the operating system.  It is buggy to say the least.  Disney+ will download through Apkpure (because Google Play basically is in operable) but will not play any sound.  Hulu freezes up on the login screen.  Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Paramount+ work fine.  Also the sound coming from the tablet when no headphones are plugged in is more than loud enough.  However, when using the headphone jack the sound is barley audible at max volume, I'm going to get some blue tooth headphones and see if they are any better.  It moves a little slow navigating the menus which I can live with, I just hate that this OS cannot operate better.  I really feel like with tech these days there should no issues having an OS that is like a phone or tablet, smooth and able to download just about any app.  This product really has the potential to be a 5 star review and in every SUV out there.  Ultimately if I didn't have the work installing these in our car I would probably send them back.

The sound quality is also pretty good, however I removed it from the video for privacy reasons. I saw some cams that are way more expensive but I have also saw that are cheaper.

It works, except the settings seem to sometimes reset themselves if the unit turns off. Also, the wording on some of the settings can be confusing, and the settings themselves don't all seem to work. There is an auto power off mode that works, maybe 50 percent of the time. I have the unit plugged into a cigarette lighter, and sometimes the camera will just stay on forever, and sometimes it will turn off. If it turns off, I have to go back into the settings and reset a few things like the option to record sound and the date. I find it odd that this camera only turns off when it loses power. It should be set up to automatically turn off when no motion or vibration has been detected for a few minutes. Motion detection works very poorly; it will randomly stop detecting motion mid drive, thus stopping the recording, so I suggest turning that off. Overall, the basic functionality works, and the 2k front camera and 1080p rear camera record constantly; it's just that the extra settings are buggy. Also, the screw on the camera mount shreds easily and doesn't connect well to the base. This is definitely something you get for an older or spare vehicle.",2022-03-17 05:57:18.047514

The problem I ran into was that things were not quite the same for my 2018 Highlander XLE and the Highlander that was shown in the install video from the manufacturer.  If you look at the pictures I've attached, my Highlander is the one with the tan dash.  Once I popped off the side panel, I was faced with  ridged metal plate that blocked my entry to feed the cable harness to the OBD2 port.  After some bending of the plastic and some minor cuts to my fingers on the sharp metal plate edges, I was able to squeeze the male OBD2 port into the hole.  Unfortunately, the path of least resistance for the harness places it in a ""caged"" off area under the dash.  There is literally a couple of tiny opening in which you can stick finger and devices in there to blindly fish the OBD2 port head.  It took 20 minutes of twisting and being mindful not to break any of the thin wires to get the fitting over to the OBD2 receptacle.  Then, when I connected it, I found the OBD2 receptacle was not attached to anything in my Toyota so it just pushed into an empty void under my dash.  Add another 10 minutes of trying to fish it out then stabilize it to plug the fitting in.  Finally success.  If I didn't run into these problems, it would have been a 10 minute install, tops.  Both software apps seem pretty janky but they work.  Now I have decent piece of mind that my wife will be driving around with a dash cam running in case she's involved in an accident.  Again, I highly recommend the camera itself, it was the install and Highlander that posed all the problems.",2022-03-17 05:58:48.987016

This wifi transmitter was really quite simple to install. The three wires from the wifi unit are labeled and color coded. One bare red wire gets power (in my case from backup lights). The connector on the second red wire plugged right into  a connector from the $19 license plate bracket camera I bought at the same time and that wire passes power from the RV backup lights, thru the wifi unit into the back up camera.. The remaining yellow wire from the wifi plugs into a matching plug from the the camera and gets video signal from the camera to send out by wifi.. Slick and simple as can be. I downloaded the app for my android tablet which worked easily for me. Then with the RV in reverse  I  went into the tablets settings, selected wifi, identified the little backup camera wifi icon and hit connect. Bingo, a nice big color picture from behind the RV. An icon for the little wifi transmitter automatically showed up on my tablets home screen, so when I go into reverse and hit that icon within about 3 seconds the backup camera image fills the screen of my 10 inch tablet.The picture is not high definition. It is bright, very clear, has good color and i would call it highly satisfactory partly because of the large screen size.. I dont know the long term reliability so hesitated giving it a 5 star.

Widawer,,Verified Purchase,,"I thought this would be very cool. My phone is already mounted on my dash, so adding this and a camera gives me a backup camera with no extra screens. Yes, it works, and it does what it advertises, and setup was easy. If you are certain you want a backup camera that works like this, then buy it. However, a device that does what this device does is, by its nature, VERY impractical. Here's why: It makes its own WiFi, which is cool. But in order to use it you need to switch to that wifi. So, if you have wifi at home and jump into your car, then you have to start the car, wait about 20 seconds for the device's WiFi to start, open your Settings app, switch to the device's WiFi, then switch back to your home screen and launch the Camera app. So that's about a minute of work, all together. If you want to get in the car and back up right away with the aid of this device, that's not going to happen. Then, assuming you've done all of that, and you're on the road and you want to access any internet-enabled app, or if you use WiFi calling on your phone at home, you MUST turn off the phone's WiFi in order to use that app (or make a call if you use WiFi calling at home.) As a result, after having it for a week, I don't use it any more. I'll be returning it. In a nutshell, if after reading this it all still fits with how you use it, then consider this a 4-star rating (sometimes there's a lag in the image). But if you're going to use it in a fairly standard way, just get a dedicated backup camera and screen. You'll use it much more.",2022-03-17 06:10:13.645075

Dooley Jr.,,Verified Purchase,,"First thing I really like is how easy you can pull it away from the suction cup to take it in the house if you wish to , other dash cams that I owned and sent back it was so hard to disconnect  the camera away from the suction cup the way they were designed this one here extremely easy, also if you need to glance at the screen which you would be glancing at an angle you can see the screen perfect the last model Dash cam I own you could not see the screen at an angle you had to look 100% straight at the screen, audio very good  I could actually hear the Truck three vehicle in front of me with loud mufflers, video quality very good since I put the camera up I’ve caught multiple  things that other drivers has done going through a red light, stop sign etc , Wi-Fi very easy to connect to your cell phone and highlight whatever video clip you would like to download to your cell phone , if you view the video clip using the app that you download to use with this dash cam top half of the screen will show you your video the bottom half will show you the map of the road you’re on and you can actually see as a video is playing a little dot which is your vehicle moving and I did notice it’s very accurate , also you can have the date stamp time in your actual speed as you’re driving stamped on the video so when you were playing it back you can actually see the speed you are going in the date and time, Night vision I actually was shocked that it was better than I thought it would be, to me it’s very acceptable and if something does happen you can make it out everything you need to make out. Camera  is very small and compact which is nice, is not that noticeable when on your windshield because of the size of the camera",2022-03-17 06:13:42.081339
B09PY8GNQW,2022,3,17,3,Super suction mount and great camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2022",Flying Fool,,Verified Purchase,,"There are a handful of videos on the internet showing the quality of the video recorded by this dash cam, so there is no need for me to elaborate here.  The GPS is fast to acquire a lock, the quality of the audio recording is super, and I like the use of a USB plug for connecting the power.  I have other cams that use a pin-type connector for power and found them to be very unreliable and prone to failure and/or falling out of the camera during off-road use.  Speaking of the USB power cable provided with the camera...it's a dandy!  It comes with both a 90-degree USB plug on one end and a 90-degree car power plug on the other with enough cable length to reach the back seat in a small SUV!  This model is furnished with a suction mount that is both small and easy to install.  It allows the camera to fit nicely between the windshield and the rearview mirror…assuming you don’t need to view the camera’s screen.  If you do want to view the screen, the handy suction mount will attach to just about any flat or slightly curved, smooth surface.  I'm just now getting familiar with the companion app that's installed on my iPhone, so I have only a couple of comments there.  The app was easy to install, easy to figure out what buttons did what and was helpful in adjusting the camera view whenever access to the screen on the camera was obscured (either by glare from the sunlight or by the rearview mirror).  My iPhone SE sometimes requires going to the WiFi Settings menu to coach it into connecting with the camera…I have several different Drive Cams.  In addition to just watch what’s being recorded on the iPhone, you can also use the app to download and view recorded data without having to remove the memory chip from the camera.  Unfortunately, there are several different versions of the camera’s internal firmware that are floating around.  An older version doesn’t allow playing back recorded videos and photos on the camera screen, while newer versions do.  You can check with Redtigre to see if an update is available.  One final note:  I have contacted the folks at Redtiger several times and found them to be both very helpful and extremely fast to respond.  Because of the quality of this dash cam, combined with their customer service, I give them five stars!",2022-03-17 06:13:42.081339

Although I still searched some YouTube videos before hiding its wires in the cracks of my car. It is small enough to be completely hidden behind my rearview mirror. It uses suction cups instead of glue to hold it in place, which is nice that I don't have to worry about glue being left on my car. The recorded video is also very clear and can be viewed on your phone. However, the memory card needs to be purchased separately, which is worth noting. Overall this is a very good product, worth buying.",2022-03-17 06:13:42.081339

It's a small/compact dash camera with the ability to record both front and inside of cabin. I had a previous dual dash camera that I had to run the rear camera wire throughout the cars trim and it was a pain. I needed a new camera but I didn't want the hassle of running wires throughout a van. This fit the bill as far as features. High def 1080@30fps quality recording for both front and rear cameras, the front and rear cameras are built into one solid device, GPS and WI-FI, The Wi-Fi feature is so awesome to be able to watch recordings through the app instead of taking the camera out or the MicroSD card out to view the recordings. Infrared LED lights for night time recording of inside the vehicle, photograph mode, G-sensor, Motion detection, Parking mode, Fatigue Driving Alert (which sends a time alert that you can set from 1,2,4 hours to take a break), easy to install and easy to navigate through menus and settings.",2022-03-17 06:14:46.692484

After browsing for a while, I stumbled upon this one. I looked at all the features and thought the price was decent so I decided to get it a try. I am glad that I did get it. It was easy to set up and to get started I didn't have to open the instructions manual. I inserted an extra micro SD card that I had lying around, hooked up the USB cable, and it worked right away. It was pretty intuitive. After finally reading the instructions I saw that there is an app for it. I downloaded it and found it easy to use. The pictures and videos in this review were downloaded from the app to my phone. It was easy to do.  The video quality is pretty clear. It records both inside and outside at the same time. The sound quality is also pretty good, however I removed it from the video for privacy reasons. I saw some cams that are way more expensive but I have also saw that are cheaper. I don't know how good those cheap ones really are though. The only negative comment I have is that it doesn't come with the memory card. Maybe they can bump up the price $20 and include one in a future release. So far I definitely recommend this dash cam.",2022-03-17 06:14:46.692484

The problem has to do with mounting the sunvisor brackets; these brackets come in all different shapes and sizes and they are unlikely to match and/or line up on any given car. To add insult to injury, several parts were defective. One of the brackets was defective and I had to carve out (using an exact knife) the threads on the mounting bracket. The sunvisor does not fit perfectly in the clip. It's really annoying. Overall, if I were to go back in time I would have purchased a different visor. I get that the brackets may not match or line up, but the parts were defective.

You can even set the 2.5k version to 4k and record no problem as long as you dont mind changing the resolution every time you start your car lol... the Biggest differnce between the 1944p setting and the 1440p/4k setting is the much wider view of the 1440p/4k, as after comparing the 4k and 1440p and 1944p video i could not tell any difference in quality.
