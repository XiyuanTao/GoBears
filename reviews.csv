        ",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,Sulfates help create a rich lather but the trade-off is they can be harsh and strip moisture from my hair so I prefer to avoid them and sacrifice the luxurious suds. On that basis alone this shampoo appealed to me but it also includes hyaluronic serum which I have only used in skin care not a hair product so I was curious to see the results. Perhaps if nothing else the hyaluronic acid will help improve the health of my scalp.

My strands would seem to snap, leaving little hair pieces in my sink, on my brush, etc. and making my hair look frizzy. My hair stylist recommended a VERY expensive hair care line, which admittedly worked but I did not want to spend so extravagantly on shampoo and conditioner. Then this Dove line came out, so I tried it. Thank God! Not only do I no longer have the breakage problem, my hair feels stronger and improved for a lot less money than the expensive salon line. The breakage problem is gone! This shampoo and conditioner do not weigh down my fine hair and I‚Äôve used them faithfully for several months now.

I have colorful hair, it is blue at the moment and I also use Overtone Deep Coniditioner (it has blue color in it and i use it to keep my hair vibrant as opoosed to colorng it every week I just use this).  So I started slacking on using the Loreal conditioner since it wouls take more time to do both.  THEN after about 3 weeks I used the Loreal again and I was really confused  as to why my hair looked so amazing!  I was like what did I do different?

Have tried other shampoos (at least the ones I'm not allergic to off the bat) and even with only a single washing they make my hair look totally fried and flatter than the proverbial pancake. Never happens with this shampoo. With this one, a single washing with the Awapuhi will resurrect my zombie hair from the walking dead. Not sure how it does that amazing feat but I'm not going to question nor complain! The 33 oz size is fantastic for the budget too. Have at times been able to score some pretty good deals when it's gone on special. Big difference in price from getting it at the salon.

It lathers very well and smells nice. I did not use any conditioner after, and my hair is soft and tangle free. I have natural grey hair that is rather dry at the ends, and this helps tame the ends.  In addition, I flat iron my hair. With Olaplex, my hair is already more smooth after the treatment and shampoo, so when I flat iron, I don't need to spend as much time with the iron! Even two days after treatment and styling, my hair is still soft and flowing. Together with Olaplex No. 3, I am already seeing the difference in my hair, and I am happy.

Shampoos I've tried before have stripped my hair of natural moisture and made it harder to keep it moisturized since I'm trying to force what little moisture was there back in and get even more. This shampoo, man of man, I could feel my hair reacting too it as I put it in. One use and I was like, well I've found my new shampoo for life. Due to the pandemic, shampoo and conditioner is hard to come by in store so I tried Amazon and I chose this specific conditioner because I already knew I liked Hello Hydration by them, and they were both coconut so I figured they'd be similar.

A lot of people think of peppermint as only something that is used during the winter, right before Christmas, perhaps, but this find is actually appropriate year-round. Use it in the winter when a combination of lack of humidity and the cold air will leave hair lifeless and dull from weather stress, and bring it back in summer to tame headaches and ease the tension in your neck after a long day at work. Lather, let it it sit, and then convince yourself to rinse away the tingle that comes from this shampoo. The tea tree oil will help keep dandruff at bay, and the peppermint makes your hair so soft! Used by beauticians everywhere. Once you experience the minty tingle, you won't want anything else to touch your tresses, so it's a good thing they have a conditioner that complements, down to being the same composition in a moisturizing, soothing formula. Fall in love, as I did."

        ",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,Sulfates help create a rich lather but the trade-off is they can be harsh and strip moisture from my hair so I prefer to avoid them and sacrifice the luxurious suds. On that basis alone this shampoo appealed to me but it also includes hyaluronic serum which I have only used in skin care not a hair product so I was curious to see the results. Perhaps if nothing else the hyaluronic acid will help improve the health of my scalp.

The moisturizer part is definitely as described: I have long hair that I was trying to wait until my wedding before I cut it off. I kept getting tangles nonstop, and it'd be a rat's nest before the end of the day and if I tried to braid it to last more than 2 days to keep from having to undo it or work out the rat's nest that got created, it would just be miserable trying to undo the braid and even worse putting it back. I was so close to just doing a pixie cut and not worrying about any of it, when I tried this, and now my hair is actually enjoyable to have long. Its 3/4 down my back, and I wanted it past my waist at least by my wedding in a couple years(we're taking our time lol).

The scent is faint and disappears a few minutes after application (I was looking for parfum free but it‚Äôs hard to find). The oil is very light and does not weigh your hair down. Most importantly though is that I just have to apply a pea size amount to my palm and rub into my hair before blow drying. Works like a charm!

I had resorted to using a stripping shampoo once per week, but my hair would be totally dried out afterward, and the buildup would begin immediately the next day. This shampoo left my hair soft yet product-free after just one wash. My hair is noticeably softer, and any trace of greasiness is gone. It doesn't strip everything off to the point that my hair feels totally de-oiled and dried out, like it would after using the stripping shampoo. The only potential drawback for some people might be that it doesn't have a strong pleasant scent that I have noticed with other Nexxus products. Rather, it has a very light scent that reminds me of incense. I use a conditioner from Nexxus that smells of coconuts after using this product, but that's just personal preference. I would absolutely recommend this product if you want softer hair that won't retain product buildup!"

I had fried my hair with years of bleaching it and decided to dye it my natural color and let it grow. My hair had been looking so harsh and dried out, but once I started using this, from the very first use it became much more soft and manageable. I will admit, The first week my scalp did get quite a few pimples along the hair line, but I have very sensitive skin so any changes to my routine usually causes breakouts. So maybe those that are complaining have not given their skin enough time to adapt to the change. I think the scent is perfect, and smells just like the salon quality stuff. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and use Biosilk before drying my hair and my hair has never been softer."

I have very bushy, wild, hair that I‚Äôve always put up in a bun because straightening takes too long and doesn‚Äôt even last a whole day. The first time I used it I left my hair down and let it air dry. When my boyfriend came home from work he asked me where I was going...I was confused because I hadn‚Äôt planned to go anywhere. He said my hair looked very nice and he knew me well enough to know I don‚Äôt ever style my hair so I must have been getting ready to go out. I went to look in the mirror and I was shocked. My normally unorganized curly frizz actually had formed into perfect ringlet curls all over. And as any curly haired girl will know, with the lesser brands you have to use so much to get the tangles out, but if you cross the fine line to too much you end up with a greasy look. With this stuff I only use 1 pump of shampoo, and 1 1/2 pumps of condition. It lasts me so much longer than the cheaper brands, so even though it costs more up front, you don‚Äôt have to buy as often which means over time you don‚Äôt really pay much more than for the cheap stuff.

I got pregnant a little over a year ago, and since then my hair has never been the same. All the products I had used for years to keep it healthy, soft and long stopped working. On top of all that I decided to start dying it myself (blonde) and anyone who has attempted to do blonde themselves knows... I finally got it the color I wanted, but I've noticed my already thinning hair was falling out more and more. I've tried too many moisture renewal, damage repair, thickening, anti hair loss products to count over thse last year with absolutely no results. So finding this product and reading reviews I was excited to try this to slow down my hair loss and give me some volume. Last night was my first use and I am beyond impressed. Not only did my hair feel a tad bit fuller in just one wash, but it is extremely soft and moisturized for the first time in over a year! I was not expecting it to make my hair feel so amazing, in fact I was prepared for brittle tangly hair like most thickening shampoos and conditioners give me. The only thing I was a little disappointed with was the shampoo doesnt get super sudsy while washing, but that's a personal preference of mine. And I may have not used enough, so I'm going to try using a little more tonight! Since I have only used it once I will update this review in a few weeks. But even if it doesnt help with my hair loss, I plan to continue using this shampoo and conditioner just because it makes my hair feel amazing and HEALTHY!!!"

The scent is nice, a little old-ladyish but it kind of wears off after a while and it's pleasant for the remainder of the day. What I absolutely hate is the pump! The pump on the conditioner opened up and works like a charm, but the one on the shampoo bottle never opened properly. I have to unscrew the whole thing in order to get my shampoo out. Because it's such a large bottle, it's a real nuisance. I can't wait for the bottle to be finished."

I took that to mean the whole product itself, shampoo & conditioner. What they don't say is that's only for the shampoo. In the conditioner ingredients it lists ""Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone."" It's arguably considered one of the better silicones, but I didn't want any. I should've looked at the ingredients more closely before buying instead of falling for the ad. As for the product itself, the shampoo didn't work for me. My hair felt drier, built up, and more brittle than my previous shampoo. I won't knock it for that because I know not all products work for everyone. I didn't use their conditioner because of the silicone listed, and used my previous conditioner with their shampoo for this time."

Compares VERY favorably against far more costly products I have tried. The fragrance is minimal, but pleasant. Hair is soft and has a fuller appearance. A little goes a long way if you have shorter hair.  My only observation is that, while the bottles are uniquely shaped and appealing, they are VERY impractical for use on the shower. They can be quite slippery and difficult to handle. They also will not stand in an inverted position. If you are anything like me, I like to turn my bottles upside down when it‚Äôs getting to the end to get as much out as possible before replacing. Still, not enough for me to ding the product itself, which is effective. I circumvent the packaging issue by transferring the shampoo and conditioner to pump bottles."

My suggestion is to have a tight sticky foil or cardboard paper glued to the bottle opening so it does not leak.  My bottle did leak but not to bad of a mess.  I had to clean it up, my counter and the outside of the bottle.  It didn't lose to much shampoo but that can be prevented with a sealed tab on the bottle opening.  I am not sending back the shampoo.  It may have lost maybe 2 tsp. fulls of shampoo.  So I am making a suggestion.  This is my favorite shampoo on the market.  Great Price."

With this shampoo I wash my hair about once in 3 days and they keep their volume and don't become greasy. Another good fact I noticed, it doesn't dry my sculpt as other regular shampoos (I am talking about any popular shampoo you can find in the regular grocery store, not professional lines).

There is no additional dye or toners etc used, just the shampoo onto wet hair!  Will buy more in for our customers for sure.  I‚Äôm not a review writer ever, but hope this helps someone get the results they would need on a budget!  But ladies it‚Äôs really strong, so read the instructions closely and step up the length of time you leave it on each time you use it, we left it on longer for another client and it went a lovely ash colour, very in trend.

Immediately I was able to see a difference.  I made sure to follow up with a moisturizing hair mask as this shampoo is very drying (was warned so wasn't surprised) and after towel then light blow dry was so happy with the result!  Cool blonde with platinum, REAL platinum highlights.  Just like I came from the salon!  I plan to do this about once every three weeks (I only wash once or twice a week) to keep up the results.

This shampoo has elevated my blond hair to almost platinum which is exactly what I was going for. I left it on for around 2 mins. Roots went a little lilac so next time I‚Äôll probably just use it to brighten the ends. It‚Äôs worked so well even my hairdresser wants the name of it!

It is very strong so my advice to you is ""less is more"". What I mean is if you are using it for the first time and don't know how long to keep it on, choose the lesser time. For example, I left the product on for 3 minutes the first time. It definitely toned down the brassiness in my hair, but it wasn't quite the silver color I was trying to achieve. I waited a few days and a couple of shampoos later, I tried again and left it on for about 6 minutes and there was quite a bit of silver tone to it. So, it really depends on what color you are trying to achieve. I am trying to stay current with the silvery blonde look that seems to be in now. I am very happy with this product and I hope more people in the US find out about it. NOTE: The picture where I‚Äôm wearing the black sweatshirt is the before shot.

As for the product itself, the shampoo didn't work for me. My hair felt drier, built up, and more brittle than my previous shampoo.

This is a clarifying shampoo the purpose of it is to clear all product build up and anything else that may damage ur hair. Yes this means it is drying however ur only supposed to use it once a week and follow it up with a conditioner although I highly recommend using a hair mask since hair masks need to be used once a week as well so why not incorporate it into ur routine?. NEVER EVER use this product if u have color treated hair in fact avoid it at all costs. If u use this shampoo more than once a week ur going to run into alot of problems but use it properly and ur going to see a dramatic difference.

As far as I've known there was only a 2-In-1. SO I bought this that very day and  tried it as soon as it arrived. Truthfully, once my hair was dry, I'm going to say that it was at its softest-- I just DID NOT ANTICIPATE an effect like that from Head & Shoulders because I thought they focused  mostly on dandruff but my hair was SO SOFT that I really just COULD not believe it. I would recommend this duo-set for 100% mostly for it's perfect solution for dandruff, but also its conditioner counterpart which happens to be equally formidable in results."

A little misleading,2.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2021",con,,Verified Purchase,,"This photo was taken shortly after using the shampoo. Unfortunately, the shampoo is extremely drying, more drying than shampoos not advertized as moisturizing. The conditioner, on the other hand, made an attempt to reverse what the shampoo did, and it did an okay job all things considering. Although, i still had really bad flakes. Now let me be clear i dont have a bad scalp, i dont get flakes with a natural shampoo. All in all, if you only buy the conditoner and only condition your hair once to AT MOST 3 times a week, its not terrible. But you're better off looking somewhere else anyways, as the ingredients do have drying agents, even though the bittle advertises as moisturizing. Last thing to mention, i dont have dandruff, i have flakes. Dandruff is caused from a fungal diseasr which feeds on the oil of ur scalp. With that being said, it probably makes sense it didnt work for me, and it probably makes sense it dont moisturize. However, the bottle says it does so, misleading."

I was thinking it was our water, not sure what but we've had bloodwork done, going to dermatologists and then today i see this post and discover nexxus isn't even nexxus anymore, it was acquired by unilever, same company as Tresumme.  This seems to have some serious credibility and I am so upset these companies can do this to people.  Why does the government allow these companies to hide things and still sell the products."

I have very bushy, wild, hair that I‚Äôve always put up in a bun because straightening takes too long and doesn‚Äôt even last a whole day. The first time I used it I left my hair down and let it air dry. When my boyfriend came home from work he asked me where I was going...I was confused because I hadn‚Äôt planned to go anywhere. He said my hair looked very nice and he knew me well enough to know I don‚Äôt ever style my hair so I must have been getting ready to go out. I went to look in the mirror and I was shocked. My normally unorganized curly frizz actually had formed into perfect ringlet curls all over. And as any curly haired girl will know, with the lesser brands you have to use so much to get the tangles out, but if you cross the fine line to too much you end up with a greasy look. With this stuff I only use 1 pump of shampoo, and 1 1/2 pumps of condition. It lasts me so much longer than the cheaper brands, so even though it costs more up front, you don‚Äôt have to buy as often which means over time you don‚Äôt really pay much more than for the cheap stuff. It also smells great all day."

After using the shampoo for over a week, I could tell my hair felt thicker and had more volume. The shampoo was gentle on my scalp and did not dry it out like similar products that I have used. To be honest I am also using this alongside their hair pills, which is how I came to find out about this shampoo. If you have thinning hair and need a shampoo that smells great, gentle on your scalp and actually works - this is the product for you. The only thing they need to improve is to have this in a bigger bottle instead of two small bottles, which is a waste of plastic and creates extra waste for the environment."

I've tried every face wash imaginable and also tried prescription face stuff and nothing would get rid of my acne :/ I only get acne on my chin, it's not very severe but it is constant and annoying (and I believe hormone related). I read online that using dandruff shampoo with ""Ketaconazole"" as the active ingredient as a face wash was really effective at getting rid of acne. I was skeptical, as I said I've tried everything from prescription creams, benzoyl peroxide, special face washes, natural products and oils and nothing seemed to work. This stuff surprisingly has cleared my face. I wash my face with this stuff in the morning and at night and let it sit for 1-2 minutes before washing off. Also, I moisturize with Vaseline on my face overnight (another acne relief miracle worker I read online--no it doesn't clog your pores). If you have acne I would suggest looking up this product and Vaseline uses as well, worked for me. Hopefully my routine continues to work. If it doesn't I will update!"

As of about April of 2020, I discovered that the company that makes Nizoral changed the formula of their shampoo to be mostly citric acid, dye, alchohol, and BHT. Even the fragrance is different. In short, they've sold out and cheapened the product, at my expense. I can't handle all that acid on my scalp. It may bother you too."

Shampoo doesn't lather that well - I have short hair and need 3-4 pumps to get my hair lather well. Seems like with other brands, I could use half the amount of shampoo. Scent was not to my liking, but this might just be my preference. It has a strong smell of banana, which I severely dislike. My hair feels dry and not moisturized at all. Overall, pretty disappointed with the product. I went from a brand that costs about 1/2 the amount and I felt like my hair felt better with that brand, which I'll likely go back to."

My hair was brittle and seemed always dry no matter what products I would put on it. I thought that I would have had to cut my hair and start completely over. However, when my products arrived, I could not wait to give them a try. I love the smells. Very nice and not powerful. I washed my hair twice with the Nexxus Shampoo, first time just the scalp, and the second wash, the hair itself. The way that my hair reacted to this shampoo was breathtaking! My curls appeared and believe it or not, I was able to pull a comb through my thick, natural, 4C  hair!! I have never, ever been able to do this before while washing. Barely any hair was coming out in my comb! I had not even used the conditioner yet. I just had to stop and look in the mirror and talk to myself saying, ""Omg, I cannot believe this""! I have never, ever experienced a shampoo doing my hair like this before. After I completely rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I moved on to the Nexxus Conditioner. Even more amazing. It stated to leave on the hair for 3 min, but I sat under a hooded dryer for about 10min with the conditioner on my hair, under a plastic cap. Once my time was up, I rinsed away all of the conditioner. My hair was so manageable!! I was able to comb and section it to do my bantu knots and allow my hair to dry overnight. After washing my hair, it only took me about 30 min to get it  all done to dry. I have never been able to complete this process this quickly before! I am highly satisfied with these products! Even though they are  expensive products, I'm hooked and will be purchasing again. I told my mom about my experience and am ready to try it on her hair also, to see if she gets the same experience and satisfaction that I got. Thank you Nexxus for such wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them. Definitely a must try on the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner for Severely damaged hair. This is my first time ever writing a review on a product. That's how pleased I was with these products!!"

I will say that if you are sensitive to perfume smells, this may be too strong for you. I enjoy the sent and the fact that my hair holds that sent beyond 24 hours. Even after using a different shampoo for a day, the smell of this one still comes through. Also, if you are prone to greasy hair, this may make it worse.

Please, please Amazon, check to be sure the lid is screwed on tightly and the pump is down.  I'm going to look for a local seller so I don't have to purchase this from Amazon anymore."

I knew I was allergic to sulfite, sulfate, etc., but it never occurred to me that the sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates in my shampoo could cause issues.  The ultra moist formula smoothed the cuticles of my hair so I didn't have the split ends, rough fly-aways that I had before, plus my scalp didn't itch.  I noticed the difference within a week of using it and within a month or so, other people started complimenting me on my hair.  I also use the conditioner and the leave in conditioner.  Since I haven't changed anything else, it has to be the shampoo and conditioner.  I love the feel and the look of my hair."

It works so well, where as the Smooth as Silk was a fine shampoo but really didn‚Äôt add much in the way of moisture or softness to my hair. I don‚Äôt love the smell of this as I find it a bit on the masculine side. Certain conditioner & product (from other brands) combos with this shampoo make it smell like I have aftershave in my hair.

I first started buying it because it had a strong peppermint smell that I liked.  The last few years, however that peppermint smell has been getting weaker and weaker.  This makes sense if you look at the list of ingredients, peppermint has been reduced from 2 percent several years ago to 1 percent and with this most recent purchase, to .01 percent.  As a shampoo it's fairly good but that peppermint smell is part of what you are paying a premium for.  I'm not sure it's worth it anymore."

Had solid reviews and it‚Äôs a well known brand so I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. After about 2-3 weeks of using it, I noticed that my hair was falling out more than normal. I typically blow dry my hair (because every guy should) and saw more hair falling out. I didn‚Äôt actually see it falling out but when I would put product in my hair, I would see around 6-7 pieces of hair on my hand after. Normally I would see maybe 2 after applying product. Also, after showering, I would notice a lot of my hair around the drain and was worried. This shampoo was the only thing I changed during that time and I‚Äôve stopped using it. My hair is very thick to begin with but I could tell it was definitely thinner and felt as if it just had a hair cut. Mind you male pattern baldness does not run in my family nor mothers and my fathers hair is like a helmet which does not thin, only turns grey. I digress. Do not buy this shampoo. It will make your hair fall out and they use like 100 different chemicals so all around bad. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk."

I have yet to find a shampoo that leaves my hair not feeling dry afterwards, but it is better than others I have tried in the past and I do like it. It kind of smells like a cross between vanilla extract and licorice with a hint of mint or something, good though. It's foamy and a little goes a long way.

I did a lot of research on organic and natural shampoos and this one went on sale so I decided to try it even though I knew there were mixed reviews. Some people have used this product for a long time but recently said its not the same and has been watered down. I think that is the case because my shampoo had a very watery consistency. My main complaint is that I could not get it through my hair. I have fine hair, but A LOT of it. I even sectioned my hair off into three parts to be able to get to the roots better. After a few uses my hair was an oily nasty mess. After I washed my hair it would dry and look super greasy even on the ends! Overall, if you are looking for a more natural shampoo, please look elsewhere and save some money and time! Also, it is good to note this is a non-returnable purchase."

It may be that the company's changed their formula as the product's consistency is much thinner (originally like syrup / now closer to water). Also, it takes a greater quantity to not only create a lather, but also to get the hair clean (now takes 2 shampoos). I contacted the manufacturer's consumer hotline and asked if the formula had been changed or if the product was now thinner - there really wasn't an answer, however, I was offered a discount coupon ($12 as I'd purchased the 32 oz size). Fortunately, Amazon allowed me to return the product and my purchase price was refunded.

The texture of my hair was so off, like tons of products where just layering on hair and would not come off no matter what I did to try to make it better.  I did some research and decided to give this a try due to being free of all the damaging products I was using and had been using for yrs that suddenly became a problem. Maybe its due my age and hormones.  Either way my hair was not having anymore.  So again, I bought this and literally a miracle happened.  Let me say, I first used dawn dish soap to strip all the crap that was just sitting in my hair which worked amazing. I then waited 2 days before shampooing again.  When I did, I used this!  I have medium length hair and trust me when I say, you do not need more than 2 pumps to wash entire head.  My hair is now feeling amazing.  Shine is back and curls are now holding.  I am so grateful I found this product.  Fabulous!!"

I've never written an Amazon review in my entire life and I probably won't ever again, but I gotta share this in case there's someone out there who it can help. This shampoo saved my god damn head. Literally. Within the past month, I've spent over $100 on shampoos trying to fix an issue I've been experiencing with my hair. I have very thick, oily, and heavy hair that after about 12 hours, feels greasy (and sometimes looks it too). About a month ago I realized I wasn't able to fully wash product out of my head even when using just a little bit and washing it out for 30+ minutes. Every single day after drying my hair for over an hour, I'd find a clump of shampoo/conditioner stuck in the back of my head. I couldn't get this out no matter what treatments I did, no matter what product I used, etc. I went through multiple bottles and brands of shampoos and none of it worked. I then came across this product and bought it as my last hope. I washed with this shampoo two days in a row and my hair no longer has left over product it, it stays soft and light for over 24 hours now, and I can't say enough good things about the consistency and sent of the product itself. If you've experienced any issues like I've had above, I kid you not this shampoo is worth every dollar. If I had just bought this shampoo in the first place I would've saved myself over $100. Seriously, buy this stuff."

This caused a lot of build up of product on my scalp and my hair to be so greasy! I did make sure I rinsed aggressively to get all the product out, and I only us conditioner on my scalp once a week. That being said, the conditioner worked great for my ends. I decided I needed a scalp reset so I bought this shampoo, and it‚Äôs been a world of difference!

About a week and a half later I noticed my head getting more and more itchy and the ends of my hair getting SUPER dry, I thought the itching was just allergies (as I'm sensitive to certain perfumes) until I realized it would be the worst right after a shower as my hair was drying. Then I realized my scalp was chemically burned (as well as my hair hence the ""dry"" ends) and immediately discontinued using the shampoo. I had an extra bottle of Aussie awesome volumizing shampoo I used instead and within a few days I had no symptoms whatsoever and my hair is back to having moisture.

There was one review saying that it burned her scalp and another that said it burns their eyes - that's probably why. Salt will strip your hair color out, dehydrate your hair and certainly strip down any keratin or Brazilian treatments in your hair. If the manufacturer could reformulate this to be salt (sodium chloride) free, now THAT would be a winner üåüüôè. I'm giving it 3 stars because it is SLS free. That's a good start, but what you gain in removing harsh surfactants, you lose in adding sodium chloride. I hope the manufacturer's will consider reformulating this product without salt."

After I ran out I tried a few other things and within a few weeks I noticed my hair did not look as nice..it was very flat and had lost its shine.

I definitely think it helps with hair loss as I have not had significant loss since I started it (the few weeks I was out did not seem to hurt). It's a little more expensive but you do not use much and running out has made me a believer.

I feel like it's doing to opposite of what it should.  My hair is more dry on the ends, and it literally falls out in double the amount in the shower.  Although the shampoo makes a good lather with just a tiny amount, my hair feel squeaky when I rinse it out.  How is it possible for hair to feel dried out when it is soaking wet??  I followed with the conditioner, and it softened the hair in the shower a bit. After blow drying, although it looks shiny at the root, it is wispy and brittle looking.  I used the products for 2 weeks, just to see if my hair improved, but it continued to get more dry each time.  I'll stick with my cheap Pantene."

Truthfully, once my hair was dry, I'm going to say that it was at its softest-- I just DID NOT ANTICIPATE an effect like that from Head & Shoulders because I thought they focused  mostly on dandruff but my hair was SO SOFT that I really just COULD not believe it.

A little misleading,2.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2021",con,,Verified Purchase,,"This photo was taken shortly after using the shampoo. Unfortunately, the shampoo is extremely drying, more drying than shampoos not advertized as moisturizing. The conditioner, on the other hand, made an attempt to reverse what the shampoo did, and it did an okay job all things considering. Although, i still had really bad flakes. Now let me be clear i dont have a bad scalp, i dont get flakes with a natural shampoo. All in all, if you only buy the conditoner and only condition your hair once to AT MOST 3 times a week, its not terrible. But you're better off looking somewhere else anyways, as the ingredients do have drying agents, even though the bittle advertises as moisturizing. Last thing to mention, i dont have dandruff, i have flakes. Dandruff is caused from a fungal diseasr which feeds on the oil of ur scalp. With that being said, it probably makes sense it didnt work for me, and it probably makes sense it dont moisturize. However, the bottle says it does so, misleading."

It isn't the same shampoo, but I have not noticed any of the ill effects mentioned in reviews here. The strong scent (coconut, I'd say) goes away as my hair dries and is rather pleasant.

After I used the shampoo, I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed until I felt like my hair was reasonably clean, but it was still so greasy that I didn't even use the conditioner. My hair is wavy caucasian hair and although I like hair care to be somewhat moisturizing and not stripping, this was FAR too greasy and heavy. I matched my hair type on their website to their suggestions and ordered this for me to use and for my teen daughter with loose curly hair. I wish I could give it 5 starts, because the ingredients are much safer than most other shampoos, but I can't because it is NOT good for typical caucasian hair in my opinion. People with dry curls may like it and it likely is great for those that want a REALLY HEAVY THICK moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it was so thick that my daughter's hair looked about 3 shades darker until she rewashed it with Acure (which we've used for the past few years)."

This curl shampoo enhances, like a curl cream or other styling product, and makes my wavy hair curly almost immediately- I wonder if it's the neem oil or hibiscus but the effect is darn visible! I love it because the look I get right after I shampoo and air dry my hair is natural, healthy, curly, and more tamed than other SLS products have gotten me. On a side note, my mom has been using Shea Moisture hair color and she swears by it too! Shea moisture seems like a reputed and effective brand because it's delivering results.

In the past I've used pureology and davines with much better results and cleaning. In fact with those shampoo I usually am good for 2 days without my hair needing washed. The conditioner is also not great. It does not make my hair soft and healthy looking and in fact my hair is needing brushed about 5x a day just to stop it from getting nappy!

I put 1/3 of the hair dye my hairstylist uses inside the bottle, shake it before every use, and BOOM you have your own color depositing shampoo that works great. First picture was taken the day I got my hair done from the salon and last picture is after the first wash. As you can see the color still looks great and it doesn‚Äôt fade horribly like from other products I‚Äôve used. I recommend using both the shampoo and conditioner and using 1/3 of the color dye, for both bottles, used by your hair stylist to create your own color depositing shampoo and conditioner. I use the Prevana ‚ÄúViolet‚Äù Color Enhancer to enhance the purple tones in my hair. I wanted to share my hair wash regiment as I hope it can help your hair color last longer. I naturally have thick and black hair but it gets bleached at the salon so this works great with bleached hair as well.

The pic on the right has my red/purple mix hair 1 month later and the left pic is 3 months later turns into a nice light brown.  The key to keeping the red longer is wash your hair in cold water with good product and I only wash every 3 days.  I also believe it's because the red was mix with purple gives it a nice look as it's faded till your next appoint to the beauty parlor.  I stick my head in cooler water and wash my hair and than I put the conditioner on and put my hair in a bun and let the conditioner sit while I body wash the rest of my body in warm water.  Than I just finish with the cold rise of the conditioner.  Its a few more steps than a normal shower but I'ts worth it to me as I love my hair and by the way I'm 50 years old.

I have a hard time getting my fingers through it as I try and rinse it out.  I really can't comment as to the color preservation abilities of it, as I think I have only used it four times.  I wish I hadn't bought such a big bottle.  It's a lot to just throw away.  I just figured I would like it.  I hate it.  I have to put a lot of conditioner in, about double what I normally use after shampooing, so I can comb through my hair.  I feel like I undo any improvement I have done with the Emergencee shampoo and conditioner.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

My hair was brittle and seemed always dry no matter what products I would put on it. I thought that I would have had to cut my hair and start completely over. However, when my products arrived, I could not wait to give them a try. I love the smells. Very nice and not powerful. I washed my hair twice with the Nexxus Shampoo, first time just the scalp, and the second wash, the hair itself. The way that my hair reacted to this shampoo was breathtaking! My curls appeared and believe it or not, I was able to pull a comb through my thick, natural, 4C  hair!! I have never, ever been able to do this before while washing. Barely any hair was coming out in my comb! I had not even used the conditioner yet. I just had to stop and look in the mirror and talk to myself saying, ""Omg, I cannot believe this""! I have never, ever experienced a shampoo doing my hair like this before. After I completely rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I moved on to the Nexxus Conditioner. Even more amazing. It stated to leave on the hair for 3 min, but I sat under a hooded dryer for about 10min with the conditioner on my hair, under a plastic cap. Once my time was up, I rinsed away all of the conditioner. My hair was so manageable!! I was able to comb and section it to do my bantu knots and allow my hair to dry overnight. After washing my hair, it only took me about 30 min to get it  all done to dry. I have never been able to complete this process this quickly before! I am highly satisfied with these products! Even though they are  expensive products, I'm hooked and will be purchasing again. I told my mom about my experience and am ready to try it on her hair also, to see if she gets the same experience and satisfaction that I got. Thank you Nexxus for such wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them. Definitely a must try on the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner for Severely damaged hair. This is my first time ever writing a review on a product. That's how pleased I was with these products!!"

Out of the hundreds of samples received throughout the years, this was the first product I was compelled to buy. My hair was dry and lifeless. This shampoo/conditioner makes my hair shiny and so soft. I've used more shampoos than I can count and this is the first to give me noticeable results after just one use. I will say that if you are sensitive to perfume smells, this may be too strong for you. I enjoy the sent and the fact that my hair holds that sent beyond 24 hours. Even after using a different shampoo for a day, the smell of this one still comes through. Also, if you are prone to greasy hair, this may make it worse. I do not have this issue typically, but at the end of the day after using this, there is a subtle heaviness to my roots. All of this being said, this is my new favorite beauty product."

I know that‚Äôs typically not recommended but I believe this shampoo and conditioner are made to treat and repair the entire hair strand. Also, it smells amazing. The thing I would compare the smell to is the Moroccan hair treatment oils that are out there. Very pleasant and it lasts after styling which I like because I love to smell good!

After the first wash i noticed a difference and after the second I no longer had the persistent signs of dandruff. At all. I have been using this about twice a week for two months and my scalp is now healthy. My hair is also much brighter and softer. The scent is lovely and the bottle is packaged beautifully and doesn't scream ""dandruff shampoo"".

Since having my second child, I have had severely oily hair in certain spots (behind the ears, underneath in the back). I can only surmise that it is due to hormonal changes after giving birth. I had tried everything, and switched shampoos multiple times. I was buying Nexxus because it was the only thing that came close to giving me a ""clean"" after shower feel. Even so, I would wash then dry my hair (a lengthy process for those with long hair) and still it would be oily. I was beyond frustrated. Finally I came across this shampoo while doing some heavy research, and it has solved the problem. It is pricey, and as others have said it is difficult to lather, so you end up using more. But it is worth it to me to have a scalp free of oil, without the damage of drying out my hair. Not sure if it's worth mentioning, but I have dyed blonde hair, and have had zero issues. So very thankful for this product."

I then tried tea tree oil, but didn‚Äôt notice any improvement there either. I made an appointment with my dermatologist and she prescribed me shampoo, but I didn‚Äôt notice any improvement there either. I scoured the internet and somehow ran into this. It was expensive, but I was pretty desperate so I bit the bullet and gave it try. Within a few days it started getting better. My sister recommended I use the Aussie 3 minute miracle stuff for conditioner as well. Between those two I have not had any dandruff in a year. Now, I did move to California and had run out of this stuff but I did still have my conditioner so I used Dove moisturizing shampoo for a week, but sure enough my scalp was dry and the dandruff was coming back. I freaked out and bought this all over again. I will probably never switch. This story really works or at least it really did for me."

My hair is wavy caucasian hair and although I like hair care to be somewhat moisturizing and not stripping, this was FAR too greasy and heavy. I matched my hair type on their website to their suggestions and ordered this for me to use and for my teen daughter with loose curly hair. I wish I could give it 5 starts, because the ingredients are much safer than most other shampoos, but I can't because it is NOT good for typical caucasian hair in my opinion. People with dry curls may like it and it likely is great for those that want a REALLY HEAVY THICK moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it was so thick that my daughter's hair looked about 3 shades darker until she rewashed it with Acure (which we've used for the past few years)."

My doctor thought it was fungus and had a medicated shampoo but once I finished the shampoo it started again and I realized it was just really really bad dandruff. Since I started using this specific line of Head and Shoulders, I haven't had any issues. I'm back to normal. Nothing else worked. I tried other Head & Shoulders products like tree tea oil but didn't do anything. I started using this royal line, shampoo, conditioner, and Instant Soothe Scalp Elixir spray. The spray really helped soothe the very itchy, dry and flaky patches in between washes. As seen by the pictures, after a couple of weeks of using all three products, my dry patches were gone. I now only use the shampoo and conditioner. So grateful for these products. I highly recommend them."

The picture on the top right is all of the hair by time I was done with my shower before brushing and the picture on the lower right is after brushing!

My hair dresser even commented and asked what I was doing differently when I first started using it.  I have fine hair and to me this makes it look and feel so much thicker, fuller and even softer (in my experience it's unusual for products to actually do what they say so I was very pleased with this).  I like the scent as well... it's hard to describe but I prefer just a clean scent (NO FLORAL), this is a little sweet (but not sickeningly).  I also like that the shampoo is clear - shampoo for fine hair should be clear as opposed to thick and creamy.  Save the thick and creamy for conditioner!...which this matching conditioner is."

I wash my hair every 3 to 4 days. With more expensive shampoo, my hair doesn‚Äôt get greasy until the fourth day. I wash my hair twice. First time with two pumps of product, the second time with one pump of product. Trying OGX, I had to use a ton of the product twice to get my hair clean. Even with this, I felt a heavy residue after thoroughly rinsing, and my hair was greasy by the next day. Some might like the scent of the product, but I found the heavy vanilla like smell to be too heavy and rather noxious. Because of how much product I had to use, I‚Äôm ultimately not saving any money from more expensive products that I use significantly less of. I‚Äôm not even going to bother using this product again. Maybe I‚Äôll use it up on my dogs or just dump it. Ultimately, this product does not give extra volume. It leaves a heavy residue and makes your hair greasy much sooner than better products."

Not good.",2.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2020",Brittany,,Verified Purchase,,"I used this for 2 weeks. 5 times all together and the last time I used it I started to notice my scalp was hurting, like from clogged or irritated pores or something. I have experienced this type of reaction with some shampoos in the past. I never knew what caused it. I love my Andalou citrus shampoo that I have been using this past year, with the conditioner but I was just wanting a bit more volume at my roots. I still have not found a leave in to give my roots volume, so I thought shampoo might do the trick. There were a ton of positive reviews and this is a fair price. So, I figured why not try it? My scalp hurts so bad now!!! I have KP (Keratosis pilaris) which is a skin condition that is basically small, red bumps of clogged hair follicles. There is no treatment and it is not contagious, it‚Äôs just genetics. So maybe an ingredient that this contains caused a flare up. Possibly the peppermint? It is a known skin irritator. It also made my hair dry and frizzy. REALLY frizzy. It didn‚Äôt make my scalp greasy, though and that‚Äôs why I kept using it. It didn‚Äôt really add any volume and combating the frizz I eas was tough. I also started to notice my hair was thinning a bit, so I discontinued use and went back to my original shampoo. My hair is starting to recover but my scalp is still in bad condition. Its still painful and irritated. Hurts to touch. It‚Äôs only been around 4 days since I stopped using it, though. This also contains sodium hydroxide and that could have have caused a problem, too. Honestly, I would not recommend this. I would recommend the Andalou citrus shampoo and the Christina Moss shampoo for salon quality hair. I am going to try the Andalou volumizing shampoo next since I seem to have better luck with their brand! 2 stars for the fair price and almost all good ingredients."

Here‚Äôs my story: I got a call to come in for a hair follicle test much earlier then I had anticipated.  They called me and on Tuesday and said I had to come in to get the test that same Friday.  So I‚Äôm stressing out because I had just smoked that same day and I had been smoking marijuana just about every day for a few months.  I would only smoke once a day though.  I did my research and the results looked pretty bleak.  But the most positive reviews I saw online was for Mike‚Äôs Macujo method.  So I did my research and found a YouTube page detailing the process I would have to go through to get my hair clean enough to pass.  In the comments below the video was Mike Macujo‚Äôs phone number.  So I called.  I told him how much I had been smoking and the last time I smoked.  He advised I do 8-9 washes over about a weeks time in order to get all of the marijuana out of my hair and pass the test.  But I didn‚Äôt have 7 days.  I only had 3 and I didn‚Äôt even have the product yet.  He advised me to order this product on amazon and have it overnighted to me and begin the process as soon as possible.  Get as many washes in as I can before my test. (Typically you would have 10 hours between each wash , but because I was pressed for time I washed every 7-8 hours ). I asked if he really thought I could pass in such short time.  He replied yes you would have a good chance of passing.  Now I thought he was just trying to make a quick buck on this expensive product , but he said: ‚ÄúI can guarantee you will fail if you don‚Äôt try my method , but if you do use the method exactly like you‚Äôre supposed to then you will give yourself a shot ‚Äú. I wasn‚Äôt completely convinced , but I was desperate because this was a once and a life time job opportunity and I had to give it a try.  I bought this product just like he advised and got the rest of the supplies from cvs . And I went through with the cleansing.  I‚Äôm not going to lie it burned my scalp, but I felt it working.  When I put the products in my hair the first 2-3 times I could smell marijuana in my hair , and then the last 2-3 times I didn‚Äôt smell it anymore.  It was crazy. Although it burned it didn‚Äôt do any damage to my hair or scalp.  I had to take the pain of the burn , but it was worth it because it gave me a shot at a great career.  I just found out I passed my hair follicle test and I was amazed. !!!! You will be too. Don‚Äôt be discouraged by these negative reviews.  People that say that this method doesn‚Äôt work didn‚Äôt do it correctly.  If you follow mike‚Äôs instructions exactly you WILL pass your test.  Guaranteed.  I was stunned when I got my results. And you will be pleasantly surprised.  Call him he will walk you though everything. Thank you mike ! I wish I can give this product more stars. Wow !"

Its a great job so figured I'd try, I knew they still tested for marijuana so I purchased this kit. I received it on a Friday used it once or twice a day for a week till the following Saturday when I was sent to do my drug test.

I ordered this kit straight away and got to work. The provided instructions were good but had me freaking out over the fact it said never give a body hair sample.

I would NOT recommend this shampoo and conditioner being your ONLY hair treatment if your hair is chemically treated or exposed to heat. I use a clarifying shampoo and deep conditioner 1-2 times a week, and use a heat protectant spray prior to blow drying and curling. I also think the quality of water impacts shampoos performance in a huge way.

They left my hair feeling ‚Äútextured, not silky soft, but definitely looking and feeling thicker.  The second time I washed my hair, I added a bit of Eva NYC therapy mask to the ends for softness (and the heavenly smell), and this combination worked very well.  I am trying very hard to only use vegan, cruelty-free, non-toxic beauty products so I appreciate that Amika hits the mark on all of those points.  The smell is pleasant, but very light (I have been spoiled by the delicious EvaNYC collection fragrance).  I will continue to purchase the shampoo and conditioner 3D duo because even though my ends are a bit dry after use, it is easy to add a leave-in or second conditioner, and it definitely makes my sad, scraggly hair look bigger!"

It seemed with past shampoos I‚Äôd have to use a lot of product just to work every crevasse & I was going through bottles way too fast. Not the case with this though. I will say however, if you've got an oily scalp it doesn‚Äôt really help longevity wise with reducing the sebum. I wasn‚Äôt sure upon buying this if it was directed more so for oilier scalps but decided it being labeled ‚Äú3D volume‚Äù I would definitely give it a shot. Unfortunately my hair can only go two days max without being washed, but I think that‚Äôs just going to be the case with any shampoo I find.

I PASSED !!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,65 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020",Thomas ,,Verified Purchase,,"I never write reviews for products good or bad , but I had to write one for this product.  Here‚Äôs my story: I got a call to come in for a hair follicle test much earlier then I had anticipated.  They called me and on Tuesday and said I had to come in to get the test that same Friday.  So I‚Äôm stressing out because I had just smoked that same day and I had been smoking marijuana just about every day for a few months.  I would only smoke once a day though.  I did my research and the results looked pretty bleak.  But the most positive reviews I saw online was for Mike‚Äôs Macujo method.  So I did my research and found a YouTube page detailing the process I would have to go through to get my hair clean enough to pass.  In the comments below the video was Mike Macujo‚Äôs phone number.  So I called.  I told him how much I had been smoking and the last time I smoked.  He advised I do 8-9 washes over about a weeks time in order to get all of the marijuana out of my hair and pass the test.  But I didn‚Äôt have 7 days.  I only had 3 and I didn‚Äôt even have the product yet.  He advised me to order this product on amazon and have it overnighted to me and begin the process as soon as possible.  Get as many washes in as I can before my test. (Typically you would have 10 hours between each wash , but because I was pressed for time I washed every 7-8 hours ). I asked if he really thought I could pass in such short time.  He replied yes you would have a good chance of passing.  Now I thought he was just trying to make a quick buck on this expensive product , but he said: ‚ÄúI can guarantee you will fail if you don‚Äôt try my method , but if you do use the method exactly like you‚Äôre supposed to then you will give yourself a shot ‚Äú. I wasn‚Äôt completely convinced , but I was desperate because this was a once and a life time job opportunity and I had to give it a try.  I bought this product just like he advised and got the rest of the supplies from cvs . And I went through with the cleansing.  I‚Äôm not going to lie it burned my scalp, but I felt it working.  When I put the products in my hair the first 2-3 times I could smell marijuana in my hair , and then the last 2-3 times I didn‚Äôt smell it anymore.  It was crazy. Although it burned it didn‚Äôt do any damage to my hair or scalp.  I had to take the pain of the burn , but it was worth it because it gave me a shot at a great career.  I just found out I passed my hair follicle test and I was amazed. !!!! You will be too. Don‚Äôt be discouraged by these negative reviews.  People that say that this method doesn‚Äôt work didn‚Äôt do it correctly.  If you follow mike‚Äôs instructions exactly you WILL pass your test.  Guaranteed.  I was stunned when I got my results. And you will be pleasantly surprised.  Call him he will walk you though everything. Thank you mike ! I wish I can give this product more stars. Wow !"

Should have known when I seen the orange sticker that said absolutely no returns. Funny thing is it didn‚Äôt show the coke I did 40 days ago which was the only time in years since I had done it but showed thc that was done much longer back and they say coke is harder to get out.

I had only stopped 2 weeks before my old boss reached out and asked if I was ready to come back to work. (I quit my job because i had a baby and wanted to take a year off to be home with her). Its a great job so figured I'd try, I knew they still tested for marijuana so I purchased this kit. I received it on a Friday used it once or twice a day for a week till the following Saturday when I was sent to do my drug test.  Used the ultra clean following the instructions exactly  that's Saturday and went in to do drug test right after hair still went in all.

I was in the very unfortunate position of having to do a hair pre employment screen. I was a very light user and It had been almost three months since I had anything to worry about but was told by the people interviewing me that the lab would be taking a body hair sample due to my head hair being too short. I ordered this kit straight away and got to work. The provided instructions were good but had me freaking out over the fact it said never give a body hair sample. I minimized the possible collection areas by trimming most of my body hair and followed the attached instructions 11 times and added an extra macujo method 5 times.

The shampoo is thick and gel-like and doesn't wash off my hair well leaving this gross residue causing my top 1/3 of my hair to look weighed down and greasy in about 12 hours! If you squirt this stuff on your had and try to rinse it off with just water you cant! It leaves a oily residue. I hate to even mention this but I'm getting pimples on my scalp here and there for the first time ever, eeek! This shampoo is getting trashed. In the past I've used pureology and davines with much better results and cleaning. In fact with those shampoo I usually am good for 2 days without my hair needing washed. The conditioner is also not great. It does not make my hair soft and healthy looking and in fact my hair is needing brushed about 5x a day just to stop it from getting nappy! I usually brush my hair in the morning and am good the rest of the day. I just can't believe there are good reviews for this product. Are they getting payed, or did I get a fake product. The good reviews seriously got me scratching my weighted down colorless head."

I‚Äôve also experimented with many products to keep my violet/purple hair color from fading so quickly but this is my go to shampoo. I put 1/3 of the hair dye my hairstylist uses inside the bottle, shake it before every use, and BOOM you have your own color depositing shampoo that works great. First picture was taken the day I got my hair done from the salon and last picture is after the first wash. As you can see the color still looks great and it doesn‚Äôt fade horribly like from other products I‚Äôve used. I recommend using both the shampoo and conditioner and using 1/3 of the color dye, for both bottles, used by your hair stylist to create your own color depositing shampoo and conditioner. I use the Prevana ‚ÄúViolet‚Äù Color Enhancer to enhance the purple tones in my hair. I wanted to share my hair wash regiment as I hope it can help your hair color last longer. I naturally have thick and black hair but it gets bleached at the salon so this works great with bleached hair as well.

The pic on the right has my red/purple mix hair 1 month later and the left pic is 3 months later turns into a nice light brown.  The key to keeping the red longer is wash your hair in cold water with good product and I only wash every 3 days.  I also believe it's because the red was mix with purple gives it a nice look as it's faded till your next appoint to the beauty parlor.  I stick my head in cooler water and wash my hair and than I put the conditioner on and put my hair in a bun and let the conditioner sit while I body wash the rest of my body in warm water.  Than I just finish with the cold rise of the conditioner.  Its a few more steps than a normal shower but I'ts worth it to me as I love my hair and by the way I'm 50 years old.

(I have been using Nexxus Emergencee Shampoo, and that is very moisturizing.)  This just strips my hair.  Even as I am rinsing it out, it immediately is a tangled mess, and feels stripped.  I have a hard time getting my fingers through it as I try and rinse it out.  I really can't comment as to the color preservation abilities of it, as I think I have only used it four times.  I wish I hadn't bought such a big bottle.  It's a lot to just throw away.  I just figured I would like it.  I hate it.  I have to put a lot of conditioner in, about double what I normally use after shampooing, so I can comb through my hair.  I feel like I undo any improvement I have done with the Emergencee shampoo and conditioner.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I guess if I had to find one good thing to say about it, it would be that it doesn't make my scalp itch.  That's it.  That's the best I can do."

        ",Verified Purchase,,"I have been using this solid shampoo for about a month now. The actual formulation is really great. It is not drying or moisturizing and does not weigh hair down. It does exactly what it says it will do: volumize. The scent is extremely mild (and I typically avoid products with any fragrance) and pleasant. My only real complaint, and it's mild, is the bar itself: I hate the shape. Sure, it's pretty and it's fine to hold, but I don't think the shape is ideal to rub on your head. I MUCH prefer the usual round shape, which all other shampoo bars use. I am guessing someone designed this convoluted shape to differentiate it from all the others, but in my opinion this bizarrely shaped (although aesthetically pleasing) bar isn't an improvement. That said, I'd still recommend this low-waste, efficient, effective shampoo. I have tried quite a few of them, over a long period of time, and hands-down, this one is BY FAR the best."

I have yet to find a shampoo that leaves my hair not feeling dry afterwards, but it is better than others I have tried in the past and I do like it. It kind of smells like a cross between vanilla extract and licorice with a hint of mint or something, good though. It's foamy and a little goes a long way. This bottle will last me forever as I only use it once and awhile. Overall, I prefer using a cowash (as I am coconut cowash-this stuff is awesome!) because of how dry my hair tends to be.

My dryness has not come back, so I will buy another bottle once I finish with this one. The good thing is, you don't need to put a lot of this shampoo. You can make it last. My hair is to the middle of my back, so it is somewhat long. I only use a quarter size amount and work it into my scalp. It works really well, but I wish the bottle was bigger for the price. The scent isn't so bad, but it smells better than other shampoos that I have used that are supposed to help with dry scalp. I look at this as an investment in my scalp health."

This shampoo and conditioner really helps my very processed and over worked hair. I will definitely continue to use products from this line. It is a bit pricey but I feel it has really helped save my hair from breaking off and splitting. It's worked much better then some other top of the line products I've tried like, Alterna, Matrix and TIGI. None of those brands really helped moisturize and soften my hair. This brand has worked much better and I will stick with it."

I used to be one of those people who used shampoo and conditioner every day. This shampoo was amazing and helped me transition to washing my hair 1-2 times a week now! I was able to apply it just around my roots and it would help remove any oil and dirt that had built up. I typically style my hair every other day or so, applying a heat protector spray and sometimes hairspray - and this was able to wash out a few days worth of products. You only need to use a small amount each time you wash, and as you gradually move to washing every couple of days, the bottle will last you a long time.

I eventually discovered UK sellers on Amazon offering the UK retail version (which is the 2% strength) at reasonable prices, and I have been using that."

When I noticed my local drug stores were no longer carrying the product a year or two ago I decided to buy several bottles online. Several months ago my supply ran out and I went looking...and was appalled to see how a $15.00 asking price was now over $150 for the same 7 oz bottle.

I've had very bad dandruff for over four years, as a result of dry skin than came on suddenly.  I find that almost any shampoo (even non-dandruff shampoos) will prevent dandruff for a few days.  Then it comes back as bad as ever.  Nizoral is the most effective shampoo I've tried.  It isn't a cure for me, as it has seemingly been for others here.  It started out great, nearly eliminating the flaking and itching.  After a couple of weeks of use about every 3 days, it became less effective, with flaking and itching starting in the afternoon -- but the flakes were smaller and the itching less intense than with other shampoos.  After eight months, it is still good, but I get flakes and itching every day.  It's expensive, but it offers some relief.

Personally, wet and tangled hair does not work for me. I can deal with dry and tangled hair already lol. Honestly, I think this product did clarify my hair and scalp and made it feel very squeaky clean, but I  really like when shampoos having a moisturizing factor with them to make it even more manageable and to not cause setbacks when wash day can be a very long process already.

But this is now completely different. It looks different, its thicker and more like a cream than a light spray. It smells different, more like baby powder then the original light fresh fruity scent it was before, and it feels different on my hair, its very heavy and made it greasy to the point I needed to wash my hair all over again. It's  like a completely different product.  Very unhappy with this. This product would be good if my hair was very thick and frizzy, but it's supposed to be for protecting color, not defrizzing thick, course hair."

The scent is faint and disappears a few minutes after application (I was looking for parfum free but it‚Äôs hard to find). The oil is very light and does not weigh your hair down. Most importantly though is that I just have to apply a pea size amount to my palm and rub into my hair before blow drying. Works like a charm!

This shampoo left my hair soft yet product-free after just one wash. My hair is noticeably softer, and any trace of greasiness is gone. It doesn't strip everything off to the point that my hair feels totally de-oiled and dried out, like it would after using the stripping shampoo. The only potential drawback for some people might be that it doesn't have a strong pleasant scent that I have noticed with other Nexxus products. Rather, it has a very light scent that reminds me of incense. I use a conditioner from Nexxus that smells of coconuts after using this product, but that's just personal preference. I would absolutely recommend this product if you want softer hair that won't retain product buildup!"

So I moved to many other dandruff shampoos here on amazon and also on retail stores that are considerably pricier than Head and Shoulder. After trying out about 10 different dandruff products, I think I finally found the one that works really well. Other products were good, but not as good as this Redskin shampoo. I had to buy extra dandruff lotions and sprays to keep my scalp calm for those other shampoos I used. With Redskin, I don't need it. So. I recommend it."

Much worse.,1.0 out of 5 stars,16 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2021",Doug M.,,Verified Purchase,,"My wife has been using this Redkin shampoo for over 10 years. She couldn't understand what was wrong when she started using this latest product in a new bottle. It took her a while, trying it over and over again, before she realized that there is something seriously wrong with this shampoo. It seems to have no soap, it leaves her hair feeling flat and greasy. No body at all. Nothing like the way the shampoo has worked for over 10 years. Unfortuantely, by the time she realized the problem was truly the shampoo, and not anything else, it was too late to return the product for a refund. I posted this complaint previously, but it was removed by Amazon because I said that this is either a fake product or Redkin has made an awful change. Amazon checked into the matter and just wrote back to say that they confirmed this is not a fake product. That is why they removed my previous complaint. That is good to know, and I appreciate Amazon getting back to me. That is helpful. But this problem is so severe that it is worth adding this new comment. Unfortunately, as I see it, this leaves only two alternatives: Redkin has ruined the formula so badly that it isn't even close to being the same. Or, perhaps this was just a bad batch. If I don't hear anything back, I will assume it was not a mistake and it is time to find a new brand. If anyone can recommend a substitute, please let me know. Thanks."

Used it for about a week, about 4/7 days (not continuous). Today I realized that my hair is noticeably thinner where I was applying it (mostly to the top of the head, particularly my bangs and along the part). I guess the thinning could be from the dye job and updos I've been doing, but this thinning hasn't occurred anywhere else on my head but the areas where I've been applying the product, and my lightening/dye is an ombre so it shouldn't affect the roots. I have pretty thick hair, but now I find myself having to take extra care in styling so my scalp doesn't show through.

It smells more like essential oils which tend to have a more powerful scent, but it still isn't overly powerful to me (and everything gives me headaches if it is). I have found the conditioner isn't as moisturizing as it claims to be if your hair is processed or overly processed from lightening or dyeing. I definitely recommend using this in lieu of a deep conditioning treatment. I have chemically lightened hair to platinum and use oVertone coloring conditioner (a semi-permanent fantasy dye) with this and it works great. It doesn't make my fantasy colors bleed too much and keeps them vibrant with the UV protection. Overall a good buy for the price."

I have incredibly coarse super curly hair that needs a ton of moisture & I have issues with breakage. This product is over-marketed to sound amazing, but doesn't live up to it's claims. I've bought it a couple times & it doesn't compare my Redken Extreme set. Redken Extreme does more, feels better & smells better than this. Bottom line, quality isn't always the most affordable, but it's worth paying for. I personally wouldn't recommend this product to anyone with damaged hair."

The shampoo wasn't the best smelling shampoo I have ever tried, but the conditioner smells great! I love how it makes my hair feel and smell! And most of all, no more itching, flakes, or bumps!

This may actually work a little better than intended - what really wakes you up is the knowledge you need to be careful with it and make sure you don't get any in your eyes or even on your closed eyelids.  I was going to stop using it because of that.  But it performs very, very well if you have oily hair that is difficult to get looking decent without having to do wash, rinse, repeat.  I wash my hair once with this, don't repeat, and it still looks good all day."

Hair feels clean, but not greasy at all. I can go longer than a day without washing my hair without looking like I put wax in it. It also helped tame the frizz. My hair just feels and looks healthier. I am hooked. Totally worth this price and still way more inexpensive than Pureology, and a worthy replacement."

        ",Verified Purchase,,I have been using the Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening shampoo and conditioner for years now.  My hair stylist first recommended it and it has worked really well on my fine and thin men's hair.  I think some get this thinking it is going to provide fuller and thicker hair that remains and does not go away.  Meaning it will over time provide permanently thicker hair.  That just is not possible.  What this does do with consistent use is after I wash with the shampoo and then use the conditioner is provide fuller and softer hair after each wash.  The fullness is very refreshing and natural.  This shampoo smells very nice and lathers up very easily.  With other shampoos I would feel build-up over time but not with this.  I also appreciate the savings buying it in large volume like here.  But what I do not appreciate it that even when purchased from Amazon themselves as I made sure to do this time the large bottle arrived with some of the shampoo leaking out the top.  It was all over the bottle and a pain to wash off but overall a minimal amount though no amount should be the correct amount.  But the shampoo itself will indeed add volume in a natural way to fine and thinning hair.

Needless to say, I ended up leaving the salon with a couple of bottles and it's been my standard shampoo/conditioner ever since. I have tried other products over the years, such as specialty shampoos that promise to improve strength, growth, and volume, but I always find myself going back to this. I really do feel that my hair is healthier and grows more quickly because of it. I also love this brand because there are several different types and scents To choose from (not sure if they are all technically part of the ""special"" line, but they do come in the same little green bottles, unlike the other Paul Mitchell products) and I've enjoyed playing around with different combinations. Currently my favorite combo is the lemon sage shampoo with the lavender mint conditioner (although I do still love the tea tree shampoo as well). I've been using these products for about 5 years now and I plan to continue using them so long as they stay available and affordable. And I absolutely recommend them to anyone with fine, flat hair like mine!"

I was worried at first because of the price but I still have shampoo left in the one bottle I bought in February.... which is insane!! My hair has definitely more volume. Since it is so thick it usually weighs down and the top of my hair on my head just flattened out, but this shampoo has really been helping with that. If you have dry hair, I would not recommend this product, I have been using it in conjunction with a sheabutter hair mask to make sure my hair is well hydrated.

B086CS8YXB,2022,1,23,1,Secret Hair Growth,5.0 out of 5 stars,47 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2021",Amy H,,Verified Purchase,,"My goal for this product was to achieve hair growth which may not be your primary motivation. About two years ago I noticed that my hair was thinning badly. I‚Äôm going to be 58 next month and I have left  what used to constitute One pigtail that‚Äôs now a single ponytail.  . I had the classic male pattern thinning above my temples and with my bangs. I was completely freaking out as my hair is kind of my signature feature. It‚Äôs always been wavy and fine but pretty. I also let my silver grow out about four years ago and the lack of processing has made my hair healthy,  shiny and soft. At the end of 2018 I embarked on this research project about how to re-grow my hair and keep what I have from hair care products, the way that I treat my hair,  and nutrition. They said not to keep your hair tightly wrapped up and to let it flow, that washing your hair every other day was better because it removes buildup on the scalp, so I dumped the Pantene and tried the biotin shampoo starting two years ago. At the same time I start Taking the 5000 mg of biotin pills for hair and nails from natures bounty that I got at Costco. And at the beginning of 2019 I research which vitamins and foods to eat which include anything high in vitamin A like red and yellow bell peppers, red cabbage, spinach, Sweet potatoes, Butternut squash and cauliflower‚Ä¶ along with almonds sunflower seeds salmon eggs and Greek yogurt.  I bough this Nizoral In April 2019. As of today I have an entire undercoat of fine new hair but it‚Äôs only about 4 inches which leads me to believe that the biotin shampoo really didn‚Äôt affect things all that much. Four Inches of hair growth is about 8 months. So I went back on to Amazon to see you when I first bought this  dandruff shampoo and lo and behold it was in April which is eight months today - January 1, 2021. I do believe that nutrition is key along with stress management and sleep course. But I find it really interesting that I‚Äôm able to trace the number of inches to when I bought this shampoo.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs 100% direct correlation but I can testify that is working for me in the hair growth department. I also found a different hair growth vitamin that I‚Äôm going to start using next week.  It‚Äôs called Hair La Vie.  Last observation. I did use Nioxin 3  for a number of years and I don‚Äôt think it worked as well as the shampoo coupled with the nutrition. Because I still had a lot of hair thinning of the temples which is now filling in considerably. And also Nioxin dries your hair out badly. I like alternating between the biotin shampoo and this dandruff shampoo because the Biotin Shampoo is less drying than Nizoral.  The key is to get it worked up into your scalp really well and just let it sit there for a while so you have to like use it less often. I hope this helps you I know How agonizing it is to lose your hair especially when you‚Äôre a woman. Good luck"

I find my hair and skin take to it better and doesn't at all trigger any acne in fact since I have so many skin allergies to face wash products and soap products from other companies I have resorted to washing my face with the extra strength version and my face has been taking well to the extra strength version, with no acne, no rashes and no enlarging of pores from it. Whether its correct or not I finally found something that I can also wash my face with that won't cause me any emergence of skin rashes nor does it seem to cause any acne and I have been using it for months. This version that is not extra strength I also use at times on my face too and I do find that occassionally it might cause a pimple or two and very occasionally some slight redness that usually clears up quickly. Now for the part that most people are interested in I have brunette and fine not thin/ thinning hair and both regular and extra strength versions even without the conditioner leave your hair extra silky smooth more manageable for my hair texture and fine hair type and bring out my natural colors and tones that are sometimes opaqued by cheap or heavily moisturizing shampoos. Both shampoos do give your hair aome good balanced volume but for all that I stated the shine the extra tones and more clearer lights/ highlights on my hair volume, and maintaining the health and luster I still recommend the extra strength version. Both are good but the extra strengrh version in my case just goes the extra mile and takes the cake in my opinion and experience. I still give this product 5/ 5 stars. I still reccomend to add the extra strength argan oil conditioner it'll do even more wonders for you and leave an even more beautiful luster that brings out/ highlights your natural highlights. üòâ"

It used to have a smooth, pearlescent quality, flowed from the bottle smoothly, had a lovely fragrance. My latest bottle? Consistency is completely changed. It's now...gloppy. That's the best word I can think of. It comes out of the bottle in sort of jelly like clumps. It breaks apart in the hand into...smaller glops. It has a completely different fragrance, nothing like before, and weak. That said, my hair seems to come out of the experience roughly the same. So I'll continue to use up this bottle. But after that, I'm not so sure. Frustrating to effectively been sold a completely different product from what I originally bought, without any 'warning' (like ""New Fragrance! New texture!"" on the bottle)."

I‚Äôve used every kind of purple shampoo imaginable, from drug store (Shimmer Lights) to high end salon purple shampoo (Matrix Brass Off, Pravana Perfect Blonde, Joico Color Balance Purple, etc). Hands down, Fanola purple shampoo gives the absolute best results! It is an incredible brass blaster and easily gets rid of any unwanted golden/yellow/orangey tones in blonde hair. The pigment in this shampoo ks phenomenal and it tones and brightens in just one wash! Some purple shampoos can be super drying and leave the hair feeling straw-like, but I‚Äôve never had this issue using Fanola before!!"

A lot of people were complaining about it being too watery but it‚Äôs about the same consistency as any other toning shampoo I‚Äôve used. I didn‚Äôt notice too strong a smell, but it did stain my hands. And make sure to rinse it off the walls or it will stain.  I used it before my regular shampoo and I always let my conditioner sit for about 5 minutes before I rinse it out. A lot of comments said it was drying so I followed up with a leave in conditioner too. So my hair still feels pretty soft. The lid didn‚Äôt leak at all during shipping either. The first pic I uploaded is right after toning, second is about 2-3 weeks later you can see the yellow. Third is the day after I used the shampoo."

I really like the scent and this stuff actually makes my hair feel softer than some much more expensive shampoos and conditioners I have used.  I think the key is, don't overuse it - meaning, you are only supposed to wash your hair 2 or 3 times per WEEK. Your hair produces natural oils and if you strip them every day by washing it, it will only start to produce more and cause more and more problems. There will be an adjustment time for sure, but you will thank me after a month! I only use this product about 2 times a week and it is good for me, and will last a really long time."

Customer,,Verified Purchase,,"First of all, the other reviewers are right about the weird grainy texture and a white residue. When I first used it, I sprayed my hair like directed and combed it out. I didn't like the feeling, so I wet the comb and used it. That made my hair feel smoother and more like it does after washing. It's definitely not the same and you can see a difference (most people might not, but girls know what your hair looks like when it hasn't been washed in a day or two), but at least takes away the gross oily feeling and makes you feel more human. I just had surgery on my ear and can't wash my hair for 3 weeks, but this will help me not hate myself. I imagine it would be a godsend for those moms who have no time to shower. Just brush your teeth and use some of this with a wet comb and you might not notice the smell of spit up on your shirt!"

It's not just a ""New Look"" as advertised on the bottle, but it's a whole new formula. One of the main reasons I started using this product was because it had very low ratings on the Environmental Working Group's website (lower ratings mean less harmful products). This new version isn't rated or certified yet, but now contains ingredients like Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate and Cocamidopropyl Betaine (higher ratings on EWG, not good!). The new product also makes my hair feel sticky even after blow drying, as though there is some remaining residue after washing.

The smell is different (similar but not quite as good in my opinion), the consistency is a lot less thick, and the color is off as well (more see-through than creamy).

        ",Verified Purchase,,"I love this product. My husband somehow goes through a bottle of body wash per week, but with this large size bottle, I don't have to change it out as frequently.  For one, the bottle holds a lot of product, and two, the pump dispenses a normal amount of body wash, minimizing the amount my husband uses.  The scent is a fairly neutral 'clean' scent, so we are both fine using this product. This means one less bottle of product taking up real estate in the shower. As for moisturizing, I still need to follow up with lotion, but my skin definitely feels softer right out of the shower."

Many soaps can clean your clean off dirt. But, they leave your body dry and chapped. . Dry and chapped skin is considered an opened wound when it comes it viruses and bacteria entering your body. So it‚Äôs imperative that  your body is cleaned of all possible  bacteria as well as viruses.  However, if your soap does that, and leaves your skin chapped and/ or extremely dry, you are actually setting yourself up for increased susceptibility to all viruses and bacteria.

It was also shipped well. The pump works, although a little weak/conservative as far as dispensing the product. It does appear to be moisturizing. However the scent is of the synthetic Lilac variety. In fact, a bit perfumy if you ask me. It reminds me of grandma's perfume. It's nothing like actual lavender or even a lavender scent blend. And I don't detect any Chamomile at all. I can't speak as to the Ylang-Ylang, as I've never smelled it before. Although I did Google Ylang-Ylang. Apparently -that- is used in perfumes.

If you're like ""basic"" level sensitive where you're not really ALLERGIC to anything but cheap stuff irritates you a bit this will probably work just fine for you, but if you have to shop at like exclusively the clean section at Sephora this probably won't be ""hypoallergenic"" enough for you."

Aveeno was one of them and trying it side-by-side with the other four brands and a few that I already have, Aveeno stands out far far beyond all the others combined. I've never used it before and now I know what all the fuss is about. I have normal to dry skin, I'm in my sixties, have tried many body washes over the years and the quality, the luxuriousness of this body wash is hard to understand unless you try it. It is so thick and soft and silky, sudses easily, rinses clean, leaves your skin so soft, smells really fresh, it's like a spa experience. The foam is very dense and lathery and you just want to not even rinse it off it feels so good. My skin is very soft afterwards. It is an excellent ,excellent product. I will continue to buy and an extremely pleased. Now I'm looking into all their facial skin care products. Wish I'd found Aveeno decades ago."

Earlier this year I realized that the skin on my back and shoulders was constantly feeling tight, and Aveeno had one of the most hydrating body washes I could find. I used an entire bottle of the Aveeno coconut dry skin relief body wash, and I decided to buy this to restock. I like it because it's very lightly scented, which is good if your skin is sensitive. It's also still really hydrating and pleasant to use. The scent isn't amazing or anything, but the soap does the job so I don't mind!! I recommend this for people who have very dry, sensitive skin like me (but I recommend the coconut one more if your skin isn't that sensitive because it smells a lot nicer and is a little more hydrating). It's even better if you can lock in the moisture with a lotion right after your shower, but even if you can't do that, it still works really well!"

I was so disappointed by the awful, musky fragrance that I didn't even notice if it left my skin feeling any better than the last 3 other body washes I tried.  With a name like ""Rainbath"", I was expecting some heavenly, light, fragrance, but, instead, it smells like cologne from the 60's.  I truly can't understand why so many people rated this so highly, given the unpleasant fragrance AND the high cost per ounce (way more expensive than Nivea and Cetaphil's competing products, which I like better).  It smells like the tar-based dandruff shampoo they also make (T/Gel), and I've always hated the scent of that stuff.  It didn't bother my skin, but it definitely bothered my nose."

The smell is amazing in the shower but doesn't stay on your skin so it seems like a waste for a great smell. It is not moisturizing wither.  I don't wear perfumes or oils and was hoping this would last on my skin but as soon as I walk out of the shower it's gone.  I like the fact they have mobile showers for homeless.  I would rather donate to that cause. I would not purchase again because of the cost and the smell does nothing out of the shower.

You push it down on the initial plunge and you have to pull it up to get the second attempt to give you enough soap.  It does not offer moisturizer.  It honestly dries your skin.  So if you have oily skin this would work.  Have been using for a year and it does clean your skin.  The fragrance is mild and doesn't last.  Which makes it alright if you want to use a perfume or colonge.  But I definitely have to use a moisturizer.

Unfortunately my local store of choice stopped selling this particular Dial scent. So I have turned to Amazon. I ordered 2 bottles. Thank goodness they were well packaged and wrapped individually in plastic because one had leaked a little bit. The other was perfect.  Years ago it was antibacterial as most Dial body washes were, but that is no longer the case. Again, for those of you in the back, it does not contain any antibacterial ingredients stop freaking asking. It's now a basic body wash plain and simple. It does no miraculous things to your skin. If you aren't an occasional lotion user, it will probably dry your skin, as all body washes will eventually.  Use lotion you lazy animal. The smell is not a strong herbal scent and does not stick with you all day long. If you want to smell like you rolled in the lavender then sprinted through the jasmine during a twilight moon for the next 2 weeks, be prepared to be disappointed. It is a light fresh pleasant floral scent. I love the scent at 37 years old and so does my 3 girls ages 4, 11, 19. My husband who is very scent sensitive, prefers me to use this body wash as it does not make him sneeze or whine like a baby about his precious sensitivities. According to one reviewer you have to be a 12 year old to like it. Guess I'm young at heart. It cost less than your monthly streaming service, just try one single bottle before purchasing a whole case. If you don't like it, don't buy it again. See how easy that was. Now go forth and wash yo booty."

We try to ensure that all individuals we serve are care for with dignity and respect, and one of those last things you can do for someone is to make sure they have a proper bath. This dial body wash is perfect for ensuring that loved ones are taken care of properly, given that proper bath, and also has excellent disinfecting properties. The scent is both pleasant for men and women, and gits rid of any dirt and debris, especially underneath fingernails. I love that it comes in a huge jumbo bottle, so it allows me to use plenty for each individual, and really allows me to do my job efficiently. I'll continue buying this product for our funeral home and would recommend it to anyone."

Well, not only does this soap feel like lotion while you're using it, but after you get our your skin is silly moist as well. Not a slippery, going to slide out of your robe moist, but just the right feeling being comfortable going to bed or to work. I was nervous about the Botanical Blossom sent it had on the label. After all, I don't want to smell like I fell in the garden or just came from Grandmas. I was pleasantly surprised by the subtle aroma and it reminded me sligly of my clothes out of the dryer. Now this might not sound facinating at first, but those around you don't always want to be knocked down with stout typical man smells either. Use this body wash, your skin, and your family will thank you."

I don't know much about moisturizing or sensitive skin or anything. I just want to be clean. So basically it was all good. Except for the scent. It has a very strong antiseptic scent that lingers for a long time after the shower is over. I used it 5 or 6 times. Finally I said to my wife, ""I think I have to get a different body wash. I feel like I smell like Lysol."" Now, my wife and I, we pretty much tell each other everything. Married 20 years and that's pretty much the way we've always been. She could have said ""Oh honey you smell fine."" or even ""Why, you don't like the Nivea?"". No. She said ""Oh thank God! That stuff is atrocious!

I should have known from past experiences 3 in 1 soaps are never good, which is why it's two stars, the soap itself is a one star. I bought the nivea men's active clean with charcoal a couple times and I like it, 4.1 out of 5, great musky smell, medium thick consistency and nice lather, one major con is if I don't lotion after then my skin gets super dry, I have skin that a light consistency lotion is great, and the problem of finding a lot of lotions to heavy so I can imagine the dry skin problem being a nightmare for people who need their thick creams and lotions. With the Men's Energy 3 in 1 the dry skin problem wasn't really a problem maybe like a third of how it was/is with the Nivea Active Clean. The smell of the Energy 3 in 1 is the same not similar to but the same as the combination of the soap used to wash your car and Dove dish soap with a splash of mint that I feel was only noticeable because I smelled the Energy 3 in 1 prior to using it and as mint does made my nose hairs stand up straight but that being said the Energy 3 in 1 mint smell was very very mild and overpowerd by the scent of car wash and dish soap, gives me a headache just thinking about the smell. The consistency is light and with a transparent blue color reminds me of car soap. Lather is OK I find myself using more soap with the Energy 3 in 1 than normal because the consistency is so light, like a third more mabye. What drew me in to the Energy 3 in 1 was because when I read Energy and Mint I imagined myself after a workout or after work taking a hot shower with the smell of strong mint overpowering my senses and the mint working it's magic and relaxing and soothing my muscles, basically aromatherapy and relaxing. I got the smell of car soap with dish soap and some mint you could hardly tell was mint, a headache, 3 bottles of headache. Just what every man wants to smell like a car wash and freshly washed dishes. Used the Energy 3 in 1 as shampoo, don't even try it doesn't shampoo well at all as you can expect from any 3 in 1 bodywash product. What's the difference between the Nivea Men's Energy 3 in 1 and Nivea Men's Cool if they both contain Menthol? Anyone know? Please no replies of the Nivea Men's Cool is ICY Menthol."

Its not exactly the Lavender body wash I was hoping and expecting... but it does a pretty good job and definitely leaves me feeling relaxed. I also don't know why this doesn't smell like the body Lotion that they have... its a more artificial type of scent that just smells off."

I am a child of the 60's and 70's and abused my skin and never used sunscreen.  I have to say this Olay Body Wash softens.  It is not too greasy and washes off nicely.  I do believe the texture of my skin is smoother.  I haven't noticed any lightening of dark sport/age spots.

It does have a unique scent to it, I can see a hint of diesel type scent if you are looking for it but really I got used to the scent quickly and I actually learned to really like it.  As far as body acne it works great, I get a few pimples from working out and this stuff really breaks down the oil on your skin and cleanses better than any of the cheaper body washes I've used.  The scent doesn't hang with you either, this isn't like axe or old spice both of which I find way overpowering even hours later.  If you don't mind paying about a dollar an ounce then get this stuff.  It does also come with three caps, one with a push dispenser, a flip top cap, and the solid bottle cap it ships with.  I personally like the flip cap, you get the best control over how much you use so you don't waste any.  Also this stuff does not lather like regular body wash like suave or dove, but lather isn't as important to me as feeling clean and it does that very well!!"

My only issue is he inconsistently filled as you can see in the picture 2 of them have less product than the others. I even let them sit out for an hour and settle before taking the picture.
