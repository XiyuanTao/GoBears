I have a ton of hair, but the actual strands are very fine and when I do my normal wash & air dry routine with this product it just leaves my hair limp & unable to style, it basically makes any natural texture/waves I have dissapear.  If I was going to blow dry my hair & wear it down straight it would probably be fine.  But that's not how I roll on a daily basis as a SAHM.

I did some research and decided to give this a try due to being free of all the damaging products I was using and had been using for yrs that suddenly became a problem. Maybe its due my age and hormones.  Either way my hair was not having anymore.  So again, I bought this and literally a miracle happened.  Let me say, I first used dawn dish soap to strip all the crap that was just sitting in my hair which worked amazing. I then waited 2 days before shampooing again.  When I did, I used this!  I have medium length hair and trust me when I say, you do not need more than 2 pumps to wash entire head.  My hair is now feeling amazing.  Shine is back and curls are now holding.

It's arguably considered one of the better silicones, but I didn't want any. I should've looked at the ingredients more closely before buying instead of falling for the ad. As for the product itself, the shampoo didn't work for me. My hair felt drier, built up, and more brittle than my previous shampoo. I won't knock it for that because I know not all products work for everyone.

Unfortunately, the shampoo is extremely drying, more drying than shampoos not advertized as moisturizing.

Now let me be clear i dont have a bad scalp, i dont get flakes with a natural shampoo. All in all, if you only buy the conditoner and only condition your hair once to AT MOST 3 times a week, its not terrible. But you're better off looking somewhere else anyways, as the ingredients do have drying agents, even though the bittle advertises as moisturizing. Last thing to mention, i dont have dandruff, i have flakes. Dandruff is caused from a fungal diseasr which feeds on the oil of ur scalp. With that being said, it probably makes sense it didnt work for me, and it probably makes sense it dont moisturize. However, the bottle says it does so, misleading."

I got this sample about 3 years ago and I have used nothing else since.  I also use with the balm and it is #hairgoals.  It makes my hair bouncy and beautiful.  I have colorful hair, it is blue at the moment and I also use Overtone Deep Coniditioner (it has blue color in it and i use it to keep my hair vibrant as opoosed to colorng it every week I just use this).  So I started slacking on using the Loreal conditioner since it wouls take more time to do both.  THEN after about 3 weeks I used the Loreal again and I was really confused  as to why my hair looked so amazing!  I was like what did I do different? So I put two and two together and long story short I will always use this conditioner since it makes my hair so bouncy and wonderful.  Plus its cheap! Buy it people your hair will thank you!"

While washing my hair I noticed an awful smell, and then I realized it was coming from the shampoo. I checked all the shower items I had been using but upon inspection it was coming from the shampoo. I then compared it to a smaller bottle of the same shampoo I purchased from target. The large bottle from Amazon smells putrid, it is a super thick consistency , and the color is a lot darker yellow tone. The smaller bottle of the exact same shampoo I purchased at Target does not small bad, it smells like it always has over the years, a soft pleasant fragrance, it’s thinner a thinner consistency that I’m used too & is a pearly golden translucent coloring, again what I’ve seen over the last several years using this product. Perhaps I just got sent an expired one? Or did I get sent a bottle filled with an inferior product? As stated I will contact Amazon to address the issue & then come update this review."

I am pro trained in Paul Mitchell as well (have my cosmetology schooling from them), and really didn’t have high hopes for this being legit, but it’s the real deal! It’s not any cheaper on here though, so if you can get it from your cosmetologist, do it. I was in a bit of a pinch, and thought I’d give this a try. The original awapuhi is a great classic product in PM, and is a very basic, somewhat gentle sulfate shampoo. This is NOT the black awapuhi sulfate free Paul Mitchell shampoo!!

Consistently my hair looks very healthy and shiny even without conditioner. It doesn't have as much body to it as I would wish it to have but I have fine hair so I know that's asking a lot of a shampoo. Have tried other shampoos (at least the ones I'm not allergic to off the bat) and even with only a single washing they make my hair look totally fried and flatter than the proverbial pancake. Never happens with this shampoo. With this one, a single washing with the Awapuhi will resurrect my zombie hair from the walking dead. Not sure how it does that amazing feat but I'm not going to question nor complain! The 33 oz size is fantastic for the budget too. Have at times been able to score some pretty good deals when it's gone on special. Big difference in price from getting it at the salon.

You say impossible but it only takes a few drops to do a good lather. Let it remain in your hair a few minutes  before rinsing. My hair loss slowed and then finally became non existent in the first few months to this day. I will never use another hair product. I figured it out to be less than .70 a month. You can't even beat that at a dollar store. 60+ with my own hair."

With all of the positive reviews I decided to give it a try.  I have to admit, I am pretty impressed so far.  It arrived very well packaged and secured so I am comfortable ordering it online in the future.  I opened it up and it smells really nice.  Very fresh and similar to the other brand we were using.  I put it in the shower and normally my kids will tell me that other store brands do not work as well, but so far, no one has said anything and they are all using it!  It lathers and rinses very well, it smells great, and it WORKS!!  So far I have noticed no itching since we switched.  I am very pleased with it!  And I have to say again, this price for a large size medicated dandruff shampoo is unbeatable.  I am very happy with this purchase!"

This is a clarifying shampoo the purpose of it is to clear all product build up and anything else that may damage ur hair. Yes this means it is drying however ur only supposed to use it once a week and follow it up with a conditioner although I highly recommend using a hair mask since hair masks need to be used once a week as well so why not incorporate it into ur routine?. NEVER EVER use this product if u have color treated hair in fact avoid it at all costs. If u use this shampoo more than once a week ur going to run into alot of problems but use it properly and ur going to see a dramatic difference.

Obviously you’re going to want to follow up with a conditioner and/or leave-in, but I have to say, my hair feels amazing now. Before using I could feel this gummy-ness to my hair?

I've tried so many EXPENSIVE brands and I really do like Pureology, but decided to branch out and try something else.  I found this at a drug store and love the combo of mint and tea tree so I decided to give it a whirl.  6 months later I'm still using it and loving it, especially for the price!!  No it's not going to perform any hair miracles for you, but it is a lovely product that doesn't make my hair more dry or my scalp more oily.  I love the mild scent in the shower and no lingering aromas afterward.  My husband loves that it's a unisex fragrance that he can use too!  I bought both the shampoo and the condition as add on items and they're cheaper on Amazon than at Walmart that way.  Can't beat $4 (each) for a good shampoo and a good conditioner!

A lot of people think of peppermint as only something that is used during the winter, right before Christmas, perhaps, but this find is actually appropriate year-round. Use it in the winter when a combination of lack of humidity and the cold air will leave hair lifeless and dull from weather stress, and bring it back in summer to tame headaches and ease the tension in your neck after a long day at work. Lather, let it it sit, and then convince yourself to rinse away the tingle that comes from this shampoo. The tea tree oil will help keep dandruff at bay, and the peppermint makes your hair so soft! Used by beauticians everywhere. Once you experience the minty tingle, you won't want anything else to touch your tresses, so it's a good thing they have a conditioner that complements, down to being the same composition in a moisturizing, soothing formula. Fall in love, as I did."

This shampoo, man of man, I could feel my hair reacting too it as I put it in. One use and I was like, well I've found my new shampoo for life. Due to the pandemic, shampoo and conditioner is hard to come by in store so I tried Amazon and I chose this specific conditioner because I already knew I liked Hello Hydration by them, and they were both coconut so I figured they'd be similar.

It lathers very well and smells nice. I did not use any conditioner after, and my hair is soft and tangle free. I have natural grey hair that is rather dry at the ends, and this helps tame the ends.  In addition, I flat iron my hair. With Olaplex, my hair is already more smooth after the treatment and shampoo, so when I flat iron, I don't need to spend as much time with the iron! Even two days after treatment and styling, my hair is still soft and flowing. Together with Olaplex No. 3, I am already seeing the difference in my hair, and I am happy. Grey hair is not easy to tame, so I have tried many products. Olaplex is the solution I have been waiting for."

The top of my head always appeared wet, but really it was just heavy coated with this shampoo and started sticking together. I bought a salon quality clarifying shampoo and it cleared it up after just one use. However, just to be certain, I used this shampoo again the next night. The following day, the waxy coating was back. I quickly threw the rest of the bottle away and haven't had any further issues using my new shampoo."

So I’ve never purchased Redkin Allsoft before, so I can’t speak to this formula’s authenticity, however I can say it has made my hair gorgeous! I love love LOVE the feel this has given my hair. I had fried my hair with years of bleaching it and decided to dye it my natural color and let it grow. My hair had been looking so harsh and dried out, but once I started using this, from the very first use it became much more soft and manageable. I will admit, The first week my scalp did get quite a few pimples along the hair line, but I have very sensitive skin so any changes to my routine usually causes breakouts. So maybe those that are complaining have not given their skin enough time to adapt to the change. I think the scent is perfect, and smells just like the salon quality stuff. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and use Biosilk before drying my hair and my hair has never been softer."

I was so close to just doing a pixie cut and not worrying about any of it, when I tried this, and now my hair is actually enjoyable to have long.

My hair is wavy caucasian hair and although I like hair care to be somewhat moisturizing and not stripping, this was FAR too greasy and heavy. I matched my hair type on their website to their suggestions and ordered this for me to use and for my teen daughter with loose curly hair. I wish I could give it 5 starts, because the ingredients are much safer than most other shampoos, but I can't because it is NOT good for typical caucasian hair in my opinion. People with dry curls may like it and it likely is great for those that want a REALLY HEAVY THICK moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it was so thick that my daughter's hair looked about 3 shades darker until she rewashed it with Acure (which we've used for the past few years)."

My issue has been that I am highly sensitive to scents and strong products so it has been a challenge. I received this product about a week ago and have used 2x already. The scent is faint and disappears a few minutes after application (I was looking for parfum free but it’s hard to find). The oil is very light and does not weigh your hair down. Most importantly though is that I just have to apply a pea size amount to my palm and rub into my hair before blow drying. Works like a charm!

I had resorted to using a stripping shampoo once per week, but my hair would be totally dried out afterward, and the buildup would begin immediately the next day. This shampoo left my hair soft yet product-free after just one wash. My hair is noticeably softer, and any trace of greasiness is gone. It doesn't strip everything off to the point that my hair feels totally de-oiled and dried out, like it would after using the stripping shampoo. The only potential drawback for some people might be that it doesn't have a strong pleasant scent that I have noticed with other Nexxus products. Rather, it has a very light scent that reminds me of incense. I use a conditioner from Nexxus that smells of coconuts after using this product, but that's just personal preference. I would absolutely recommend this product if you want softer hair that won't retain product buildup!"

I can only imagine how damaged my hair would be if I continued use.  I do not recommend purchasing.

My hair is extremely fine and straight, I also have very sensitive skin, and I have had difficulty finding a shampoo that did not irritate my scalp or make my hair oily or flat.

It's arguably considered one of the better silicones, but I didn't want any. I should've looked at the ingredients more closely before buying instead of falling for the ad. As for the product itself, the shampoo didn't work for me. My hair felt drier, built up, and more brittle than my previous shampoo. I won't knock it for that because I know not all products work for everyone.

Couple of observations. Pump is difficult to use - need to physically raise pump after depressing, and each pump doesn't deliver enough shampoo. Shampoo doesn't lather that well - I have short hair and need 3-4 pumps to get my hair lather well. Seems like with other brands, I could use half the amount of shampoo. Scent was not to my liking, but this might just be my preference. It has a strong smell of banana, which I severely dislike. My hair feels dry and not moisturized at all. Overall, pretty disappointed with the product. I went from a brand that costs about 1/2 the amount and I felt like my hair felt better with that brand, which I'll likely go back to."

I have very bushy, wild, hair that I’ve always put up in a bun because straightening takes too long and doesn’t even last a whole day. The first time I used it I left my hair down and let it air dry. When my boyfriend came home from work he asked me where I was going...I was confused because I hadn’t planned to go anywhere. He said my hair looked very nice and he knew me well enough to know I don’t ever style my hair so I must have been getting ready to go out. I went to look in the mirror and I was shocked. My normally unorganized curly frizz actually had formed into perfect ringlet curls all over. And as any curly haired girl will know, with the lesser brands you have to use so much to get the tangles out, but if you cross the fine line to too much you end up with a greasy look. With this stuff I only use 1 pump of shampoo, and 1 1/2 pumps of condition. It lasts me so much longer than the cheaper brands, so even though it costs more up front, you don’t have to buy as often which means over time you don’t really pay much more than for the cheap stuff. It also smells great all day."

It may be that the company's changed their formula as the product's consistency is much thinner (originally like syrup / now closer to water). Also, it takes a greater quantity to not only create a lather, but also to get the hair clean (now takes 2 shampoos). I contacted the manufacturer's consumer hotline and asked if the formula had been changed or if the product was now thinner - there really wasn't an answer, however, I was offered a discount coupon ($12 as I'd purchased the 32 oz size). Fortunately, Amazon allowed me to return the product and my purchase price was refunded. As the product was sold / shipped by Amazon, I have no way of knowing whether the product was shipped directly from Avalon Organics or an independent distributor. I'll not buy the product again."

I read online that using dandruff shampoo with ""Ketaconazole"" as the active ingredient as a face wash was really effective at getting rid of acne. I was skeptical, as I said I've tried everything from prescription creams, benzoyl peroxide, special face washes, natural products and oils and nothing seemed to work. This stuff surprisingly has cleared my face. I wash my face with this stuff in the morning and at night and let it sit for 1-2 minutes before washing off. Also, I moisturize with Vaseline on my face overnight (another acne relief miracle worker I read online--no it doesn't clog your pores). If you have acne I would suggest looking up this product and Vaseline uses as well, worked for me. Hopefully my routine continues to work. If it doesn't I will update!"

With this type of shampoo/conditioner, for the price, it’s not worth it. Imagine paying for this 2X per month! It’s also not very “creamy”, so you have to use moreover it  (it’s kinda “runny”).

I wanted to splurge on my hair and give myself the best hair color protectant and nourisher. I have now used this product for several months. The scent of the shampoo is refreshing, and the conditioner makes my hair feel very soft and combable. HOWEVER, my hair started to fall out in bunches!! At first, I thought this was just my age and changes in hormones. But the change was just too significant, and kindof horrifying. So I finally switched to a natural shampoo and conditioner (which also works really well, has nice scent, and leaves hair soft). And after 1 short week, my hair loss has reduced to normal amounts. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED that I spent over 100$ on this shampoo/conditioner set, and it is HARMFUL to my scalp. Now I pretty much have to throw it away, because I wouldn't gift hairloss to anyone I like."

I’m surprised they don’t call it a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner. I don’t even use conditioner anymore. The stores no longer sell it in my area so I found it on Amazon and bought 2 bottles. I’ve told my girlfriend to use it but she surprisingly never has maybe she thinks there’s no way a man’s shampoo could be better than a woman’s shampoo. I actually don’t want her to use it cuz she’ll probably run me out of it. I use pomade or gel on my hair everyday and this stuff is able to keep my hair moisturized.

Luckily, this has been great for me. My dandruff and dry scalp was so bad that I would get really bad dry spots that looked like scales and underneath my skin was so red and raw. My doctor thought it was fungus and had a medicated shampoo but once I finished the shampoo it started again and I realized it was just really really bad dandruff. Since I started using this specific line of Head and Shoulders, I haven't had any issues. I'm back to normal. Nothing else worked. I tried other Head & Shoulders products like tree tea oil but didn't do anything. I started using this royal line, shampoo, conditioner, and Instant Soothe Scalp Elixir spray. The spray really helped soothe the very itchy, dry and flaky patches in between washes. As seen by the pictures, after a couple of weeks of using all three products, my dry patches were gone. I now only use the shampoo and conditioner. So grateful for these products. I highly recommend them."

I could still smell it weeks later just by walking into my bathroom. The sulfur (or as a previous reviewer said, sewer) odor became more pronounced when actually taking a shower...

My suggestion is to have a tight sticky foil or cardboard paper glued to the bottle opening so it does not leak.  My bottle did leak but not to bad of a mess.  I had to clean it up, my counter and the outside of the bottle.  It didn't lose to much shampoo but that can be prevented with a sealed tab on the bottle opening.  I am not sending back the shampoo.

After using the shampoo for over a week, I could tell my hair felt thicker and had more volume. The shampoo was gentle on my scalp and did not dry it out like similar products that I have used. To be honest I am also using this alongside their hair pills, which is how I came to find out about this shampoo. If you have thinning hair and need a shampoo that smells great, gentle on your scalp and actually works - this is the product for you. The only thing they need to improve is to have this in a bigger bottle instead of two small bottles, which is a waste of plastic and creates extra waste for the environment."

What was wrong?  Does hair grow immune or something weird like that?  I was thinking I’d have to have a colorist dye it in a salon or live with mouse-colored hair forever more.  But Google showed the answer!  It comes down to this: as we use ‘special’ hair care products - like for frizzy or dry hair etc - our hair is absorbing chemicals and additives to the point that coloring can’t get through to the hair shaft.

I was much younger then, not married. 81 now,, and the ladies would say 'Oh, you smell good'. Well, I found an old bottle of Prell from many years past, hidden away under stuff. I used it and low and behold, it still had the smell. My wife, who is the only one that matters now made the same comment as it was in the old days.  I ordered some from Amazon and I noticed the color is lighter, and it only had a very faint Prell smell. Very disappointed. It's like Old Spice deodorant original, like Prell, No it is not. Nothing like it. Too bad."

The feel and lather in the hair is also totally and 100% different. After a few week’s use my hair was totally dried out and frizzy. This was not the case at all in the last year buying direct.

I bought this because of rave reviews by a YouTube cosmetology teacher who broke down the different hair types. I am a 3b/3c going from relaxed + (formaldehyde version,  currently USA banned) keratin blowout to natural. The transition period is nasty!! I have to admit that this shampoo (combined with an amazing protein conditioner) has reduced the hair breakage of my natural hair. After the 3rd wash it doesn't suds up as much so you will need a clarifying shampoo to get excess oil buildup off, but for African american hair, this definitely retains moisture. Its also with noting that this shampoo (plus a protein conditioner) has reduced the amount of heat i need for flat ironing. I use to have tobuse 400 degrees, but today I only needed 295 for bone flat hair. So is it the shampoo or the conditioner? IDK. You decide."

I don’t love the smell of this as I find it a bit on the masculine side. Certain conditioner & product (from other brands) combos with this shampoo make it smell like I have aftershave in my hair.

I've been buying this shampoo (and conditioner) for almost 10 years from CVS and Ulta.  It works well on my color-treated hair; my color is less likely to fade using this, and it moisturizes to boot.  I'm pretty sure this larger 33.8 oz bottle (which was a deal at $19.30) was watered down/cut with a lower-quality shampoo, though.  Like I said, I've been using it for years, and this bottle *did not* smell the same.  It also didn't lather as well, nor did it moisturize as well.  Hence the 1 star.  The seller was ""The Best of Beauty,"" which, oddly, has great reviews.  I'll be getting this shampoo from CVS and Ulta from now on, which has better quality control."

Buy this. Especially if you don’t plan on using conditioner or using any product in your hair. My husband and I have fine very long dense natural both wavy/straighter hair and curly/wavy hair! It smells so good and isn’t too gender oriented in appearance or scent! It’s not masculine, nor feminine just clean but also fruity/sweet smelling but Not in any actually resembling fruits way or confections. I don’t like that type of smell where you smell like a food or something other than a perfume or clean fresh scent-I’m not into that crap. No worries with the smell. If you prefer no fragrance or are sensitive maybe look for something fragrance free or consider that you may find it too strong. It’s moisturizing but without feeling greasy or unwashed. People and their sulfate free oily feeling hair. I’m not into that. I need to feel clean, squeaky clean. I like lather, lots of it! This is rich thick and creamy feeling along with clean. It won’t strip the heck out if your hair like a clarifying shampoo. I have their volumizing one Too! Though it smells great not as great as this one, but it’s a lighter formula in that it literally feels lighter and hair is lifted but also without stripping it. I love their conditioner but I keep a tub of biolage matrix hydrating conditioner for those rare occasions I need it after heavy styling like a roller set teasing and lots of hair spray and dusting powder for an updo for example, or when my hair feels dry. I don’t use a clarifying shampoo in those cases or the volumizing one I just wash twice! I use volumizing shampoo when I feel my hair is too hydrated and needs protein. I keep a protein mask on hand Incase it’s time to use it I use the kerestasse one loreal red tub treatment rare as hell that I would use this."

My hair is wavy caucasian hair and although I like hair care to be somewhat moisturizing and not stripping, this was FAR too greasy and heavy. I matched my hair type on their website to their suggestions and ordered this for me to use and for my teen daughter with loose curly hair. I wish I could give it 5 starts, because the ingredients are much safer than most other shampoos, but I can't because it is NOT good for typical caucasian hair in my opinion. People with dry curls may like it and it likely is great for those that want a REALLY HEAVY THICK moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it was so thick that my daughter's hair looked about 3 shades darker until she rewashed it with Acure (which we've used for the past few years)."

I just had to. For one it smells AMAZING, like baby powder but more flowery. My hair isn’t super dry or anything, and it’s not fine, but it’s also not thick. I experience normal frizziness and dryness, and often times fly aways, but since I started using these products my hair is the hair I always wanted to have. Even after using just the shampoo my hair feels like it’s already conditioned. No need to worry about over washing with this shampoo. My hair has been sleek, shiny, silky, easy to deal with, and smells GREAT. I highly recommend! :)"

My hair is naturally wavy and will dry kinda frizzy. Even trying to blow it out and straighten it takes a lot.

I only wash my hair about 2 times a week and rinse it out every day in between and my hair continues to look good even in between washes! I am Soo happy I tried this line!!

It smells amazing (like all Amika) and totally moisturizes my hair without making it totally slippery or limp. It's not giving my hair as much volume as a volumizing shampoo, of course, but it's not totally weighing my hair down, either. Trying to be a little gentler on my hair since I'm not leaving the house as much and this is really doing the trick. It's like the Goldilocks option - not too heavy, not too light, and my hair looks and feels good regardless of whether I let it air dry or blow it dry with volumizing products. And I find that my hair is getting greasy more slowly - partly because it's winter, but I think it's also because this is so nourishing."

I wash my hair about every 3 days and was experiencing severe dryness, flakes, and irritation right out of the shower. It was so frustrating and I felt so unclean even though I wasn’t doing anything different than I always had. I tried so many different shampoos and conditioners- ones with tea tree oil or designed specifically for hydration and dry scalp. I also tried out different remedies recommended by my hair stylist. All to no avail. This was my last resort and I am SO happy I purchased this set. After one wash, I HAD NO FLAKES OR IRRITATION. My hair is so smooth and shiny and I truly forgot what it was like.

You can feel that your hair is squeaky to the touch after shampoo.  The conditioner is hard to rinse off, because it includes acrylate copolymer (a plastic coating for your hair) in the ingredients. Unilever chemists have no idea what constitutes a natural product.  You will also find dipropylene glycol and ppg, which are thin petroleum jellies, in the ingredients.

The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling soft and moisturized, and I also like that the ingredients are more natural. It is a good price for a more natural shampoo compared to other ones I have bought before. However, the shampoo does not clean my hair thoroughly. My hair is very fine and thin, so it doesn't seem like it would be that difficult for the shampoo to penetrate all my hair, but after I wash it, the top layer looks clean, but underneath is still greasy! I even will shampoo my hair 2 or sometimes  times very thoroughly, but my hair still is grimey feeling underneath! I'm so dissappointed because I love everything else about this shampoo and conditioner. But I have to use to much of the shampoo every time, and it doesn't even clean my hair properly.

I have an in-store purchased bottle of extra strengh, and I have the bottle I received through amazon, they are the same. Also the seller is OGX themselves, not a third party. You may not like it in comparison to the original, I personally do (I wouldn't have purchased it again if I didn't like it!) Both formulas have pros and cons, and I prefer extra strengh. I think it works great. Give it a try, it might work for you. I mostly wanted to post this review to help clear up the misconception that this is a fake. It's real."

I even resorted to using Head & Shoulders, even though I've not had any flaking, just to try to reduce some of the gunk on my scalp. So I won't be ordering this again.

The smell is just a little off, and the consistency of the shampoo as it’s being poured into my hands feel very different than previous bottles purchased at the store. I could be wrong, but I’ve been using this shampoo for so long with rarely any other shampoo brands in between since this is my go-to shampoo. I used it all and my hair did get the benefits from it, but not as soft as it would have been with previous shampoo bottles bought from store. I don’t think I’ll be ordering again because of my suspicions and less positive results I experienced with this particular bottle vs store bought (real deal)."

Since using these products my hair has been lifeless, oily (my scalp is even breaking out) and the natural curls and waves are actually gone.  It's hanging in limp strings. I have repeatedly used a  clarifying shampoo every day since, and it is still oily, limp and barely waving at the ends.

Although the shampoo makes a good lather with just a tiny amount, my hair feel squeaky when I rinse it out.  How is it possible for hair to feel dried out when it is soaking wet??  I followed with the conditioner, and it softened the hair in the shower a bit. After blow drying, although it looks shiny at the root, it is wispy and brittle looking.

There was one review saying that it burned her scalp and another that said it burns their eyes - that's probably why. Salt will strip your hair color out, dehydrate your hair and certainly strip down any keratin or Brazilian treatments in your hair. If the manufacturer could reformulate this to be salt (sodium chloride) free, now THAT would be a winner 🌟🙏. I'm giving it 3 stars because it is SLS free. That's a good start, but what you gain in removing harsh surfactants, you lose in adding sodium chloride. I hope the manufacturer's will consider reformulating this product without salt."

Roots went a little lilac so next time I’ll probably just use it to brighten the ends. It’s worked so well even my hairdresser wants the name of it!

It is very strong so my advice to you is ""less is more"". What I mean is if you are using it for the first time and don't know how long to keep it on, choose the lesser time. For example, I left the product on for 3 minutes the first time. It definitely toned down the brassiness in my hair, but it wasn't quite the silver color I was trying to achieve. I waited a few days and a couple of shampoos later, I tried again and left it on for about 6 minutes and there was quite a bit of silver tone to it. So, it really depends on what color you are trying to achieve. I am trying to stay current with the silvery blonde look that seems to be in now. I am very happy with this product and I hope more people in the US find out about it. NOTE: The picture where I’m wearing the black sweatshirt is the before shot.

I've never written an Amazon review in my entire life and I probably won't ever again, but I gotta share this in case there's someone out there who it can help. This shampoo saved my god damn head. Literally. Within the past month, I've spent over $100 on shampoos trying to fix an issue I've been experiencing with my hair. I have very thick, oily, and heavy hair that after about 12 hours, feels greasy (and sometimes looks it too). About a month ago I realized I wasn't able to fully wash product out of my head even when using just a little bit and washing it out for 30+ minutes. Every single day after drying my hair for over an hour, I'd find a clump of shampoo/conditioner stuck in the back of my head. I couldn't get this out no matter what treatments I did, no matter what product I used, etc. I went through multiple bottles and brands of shampoos and none of it worked. I then came across this product and bought it as my last hope. I washed with this shampoo two days in a row and my hair no longer has left over product it, it stays soft and light for over 24 hours now, and I can't say enough good things about the consistency and sent of the product itself. If you've experienced any issues like I've had above, I kid you not this shampoo is worth every dollar. If I had just bought this shampoo in the first place I would've saved myself over $100.

That always worked well for me. I decided to try the micro oil shampoo/conditioner, because I felt like my scalp was getting too dry. That was unfortunately a mistake. This caused a lot of build up of product on my scalp and my hair to be so greasy! I did make sure I rinsed aggressively to get all the product out, and I only us conditioner on my scalp once a week. That being said, the conditioner worked great for my ends. I decided I needed a scalp reset so I bought this shampoo, and it’s been a world of difference! My hair gets squeaky clean but I don’t have a dry scalp! I have noticed my ends looking a little ragged, but I also haven’t gotten my hair cut in almost a year.

I have been using this shampoo for months now, and use it only when I want my hair to last longer than 24 hours. I scrub it into my scalp in the shower, wait 2-3 minutes before rinsing, and then only put conditioner from the middle to the ends of my hair. Doing this before blow drying and styling makes my hair last 2 days usually (sometimes I can even pull off 3), instead of less than 1. I 100% recommend this product if you're tired of washing your hair every single day."

        ",Verified Purchase,,"I need to use a clarifying shampoo about 1-2 days a week because of all of the dry shampoo, texturizer, and hairspray that I use. I usually use a color protecting shampoo and an extremely moisturizing conditioner. I've found that hairspray can cause a lot of build up so once in a while I need to make sure I really get it out of my hair. This does the trick and because it's Biolage... it smells AMAZING!! My hairdresser was impressed with how soft and light my hair felt. Don't use this too much or else it can be drying. A little goes a long way. It suds up pretty well :)"

When it came it had a different cap than the ones at Ulta but it looked/smelled the exact same so I thought nothing of it. About a week and a half later I noticed my head getting more and more itchy and the ends of my hair getting SUPER dry, I thought the itching was just allergies (as I'm sensitive to certain perfumes) until I realized it would be the worst right after a shower as my hair was drying. Then I realized my scalp was chemically burned (as well as my hair hence the ""dry"" ends) and immediately discontinued using the shampoo. I had an extra bottle of Aussie awesome volumizing shampoo I used instead and within a few days I had no symptoms whatsoever and my hair is back to having moisture. I recommend the product BUT NOT from this distributor."

After trying this I did notice  that when I got out of the shower I needed to put in leave in conditioner. it did kind of leave my hair feeling a little tangly. leave in conditioner takes care of all that also I used my wet hair brush it’s a brand name hair brush that helps D tangle hair. I feel like the people that gave this a bad review did not give it a chance to actually work so I stuck through and kept using it after one week of using the shampoo and conditioner I stopped losing gobs of hair in the shower Before this I even quit washing my hair because I was tired of losing so much hair I really feel that it was the store-bought shampoos that I was using they have shelflife chemicals in them they’re just not good. this shampoo I can honestly say has improved the amount of hair that I was losing in between washes I can also say I am seeing a little bit of hair growth I’m gonna give it like I said three more months to see where were at. Ps. My bf even noticed I wasn’t leaving behind so much hair in the bath anymore and thanked me for finally cleaning it up I laughed told him it’s not me it’s the shampoo but your welcome.🤪😎

It is super curly and light.  I also ordered the conditioner  which I love!

I thought it was so promising when I first pumped out the shampoo as the consistency was so thick and creamy, but once I lathered my hair, I could feel my hair getting stripped of its natural oils immediately. I mistakenly bought the largest bottle and spent too much money on it, thinking it was going to be worth it based on all the positive reviews. This product did more damage than repair to my already damaged hair. Besides that, the scent is not pleasant. It smells like strong perfume made in the 80s. I feel like I was duped.

Unfortunately, the shampoo is extremely drying, more drying than shampoos not advertized as moisturizing. The conditioner, on the other hand, made an attempt to reverse what the shampoo did, and it did an okay job all things considering. Although, i still had really bad flakes. Now let me be clear i dont have a bad scalp, i dont get flakes with a natural shampoo. All in all, if you only buy the conditoner and only condition your hair once to AT MOST 3 times a week, its not terrible. But you're better off looking somewhere else anyways, as the ingredients do have drying agents, even though the bittle advertises as moisturizing. Last thing to mention, i dont have dandruff, i have flakes. Dandruff is caused from a fungal diseasr which feeds on the oil of ur scalp. With that being said, it probably makes sense it didnt work for me, and it probably makes sense it dont moisturize. However, the bottle says it does so, misleading."

B079RJ4Y7B,2022,1,20,1,The Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner are amazing products,5.0 out of 5 stars,170 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2018",PSingletary,,Verified Purchase,,"I decided to order the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner for severely damaged hair cause I was having a lot of hair breakage and shedding and I absolutely resented hair wash days. My hair was brittle and seemed always dry no matter what products I would put on it. I thought that I would have had to cut my hair and start completely over. However, when my products arrived, I could not wait to give them a try. I love the smells. Very nice and not powerful. I washed my hair twice with the Nexxus Shampoo, first time just the scalp, and the second wash, the hair itself. The way that my hair reacted to this shampoo was breathtaking! My curls appeared and believe it or not, I was able to pull a comb through my thick, natural, 4C  hair!! I have never, ever been able to do this before while washing. Barely any hair was coming out in my comb! I had not even used the conditioner yet. I just had to stop and look in the mirror and talk to myself saying, ""Omg, I cannot believe this""! I have never, ever experienced a shampoo doing my hair like this before. After I completely rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I moved on to the Nexxus Conditioner. Even more amazing. It stated to leave on the hair for 3 min, but I sat under a hooded dryer for about 10min with the conditioner on my hair, under a plastic cap. Once my time was up, I rinsed away all of the conditioner. My hair was so manageable!! I was able to comb and section it to do my bantu knots and allow my hair to dry overnight. After washing my hair, it only took me about 30 min to get it  all done to dry. I have never been able to complete this process this quickly before! I am highly satisfied with these products! Even though they are  expensive products, I'm hooked and will be purchasing again. I told my mom about my experience and am ready to try it on her hair also, to see if she gets the same experience and satisfaction that I got. Thank you Nexxus for such wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them. Definitely a must try on the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner for Severely damaged hair. This is my first time ever writing a review on a product. That's how pleased I was with these products!!"

Out of the hundreds of samples received throughout the years, this was the first product I was compelled to buy. My hair was dry and lifeless. This shampoo/conditioner makes my hair shiny and so soft. I've used more shampoos than I can count and this is the first to give me noticeable results after just one use. I will say that if you are sensitive to perfume smells, this may be too strong for you. I enjoy the sent and the fact that my hair holds that sent beyond 24 hours. Even after using a different shampoo for a day, the smell of this one still comes through. Also, if you are prone to greasy hair, this may make it worse. I do not have this issue typically, but at the end of the day after using this, there is a subtle heaviness to my roots. All of this being said, this is my new favorite beauty product."

Snyder,,Verified Purchase,,"I really love this shampoo. I tried it for the first time today. I will say that I was worried at first while I was washing my hair because it felt “heavy” and like my hair would be greasy as someone else in the reviews had stated. I do have thin hair so this is a concern. However what you need to know is that as soon as you put the conditioner on that feeling disappears so make sure you condition all the way to your roots. I know that’s typically not recommended but I believe this shampoo and conditioner are made to treat and repair the entire hair strand. Also, it smells amazing. The thing I would compare the smell to is the Moroccan hair treatment oils that are out there. Very pleasant and it lasts after styling which I like because I love to smell good! If you’re unsure whether you’ll like this shampoo then buy the smaller bottles first. And remember to use the shampoo and conditioner together and your hair will turn out smooth and shiny!"

I ordered this due to reading reviews from r/curlyhair on Reddit. Initially I didn’t have high hopes for it because as a beginner to fixing my potential curly hair, I wasn’t sure if a quick shampoo fix would be enough for my hair. After using this product for well over a year now, I have never seen my hair more healthier! I do not use any heat products and wash my hair every other day, sometimes 2 days in between, and my hair has now the natural curls that have been hiding in the frizz this whole time! I also use the Shea Moisture conditioner after I shampoo my hair and I use my comb to comb it out when I’m in the shower. This shampoo works wonders for curly hair!!!!"

I had fried my hair with years of bleaching it and decided to dye it my natural color and let it grow. My hair had been looking so harsh and dried out, but once I started using this, from the very first use it became much more soft and manageable. I will admit, The first week my scalp did get quite a few pimples along the hair line, but I have very sensitive skin so any changes to my routine usually causes breakouts. So maybe those that are complaining have not given their skin enough time to adapt to the change. I think the scent is perfect, and smells just like the salon quality stuff. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and use Biosilk before drying my hair and my hair has never been softer."

After few washes my ash blonde gets warmer and brassy tones appear in the crown area (I used to be a much lighter blonde, so the color washes out quite quickly from my hair). Purple shampoos do not work for me cause they bring out the brassy reds. I was looking for something that will extend my dark blonde and keep the undertone cooler. This shampoo did it for me. I keep it on for 5-10 mins (depending on the intensity I need) and it actually works, it gives a caramel hue to where I would previously get brassy tones. I started using the matching conditioner too. The only down side is it does dry my hair, so I have to moisturize with pre wash balm and use a mask every time after I wash, plus the serum before drying."

Let me first say I have well water, I use heat on my hair and get highlights on my long fine hair so I have some pretty extensive damage. Short of cutting it all off (not ready for that yet) I decided to give it a try after a YouTuber I follow recommended it for my healthier hair journey. I've used A LOT of salon quality shampoos in the past, never being impressed for all the money I fork out on them. My last shampoo purchase was a drugstore brand that I got because it was the most amazing smelling stuff ever and I was tired of spending money and getting the same results. (I know, blasphemy). Finally coming to grips I needed to spend the money and switch back to a better brand if I was ever going to heal my damaged hair, I took the leap. And let me tell you I'm so glad I did. First off, I didn't even mind getting rid of the drug store brand after I used this stuff. Holy heavens to Betsy, it smells amazing! I've been sniffing my hair all day! My hair feels super soft, it's shiny and frizzy split ends are softer and less noticeable. This is after ONE wash y'all. I can't wait to see what it does after 6 months of use, combined with the other changes I'm making for healthier hair. Once I've used it more, I'll leave another updated review about how long the shampoo/conditioner has lasted and how it's helped my hair. I didn't have any close up before pics but I hope this review helps if you're considering buying. As of right now, I highly recommend this product!"

With this particular Nexxus I'm a believer. I'm getting to an age where my hair is starting to thin a bit on the top so I want to make what's left up there look as full and shiny as possible. I've tried a bunch of shampoos that leave my mane either flat and greasy (as in the case of moisturizing shampoos) or dry as a bone and staticy once I blow dry it (as in the case of most clarifying shampoos) but this version of Nexxus hit's the sweet spot. It has a subtle fragrance that's sophisticated yet very low key (it smells expensive but quietly so  .. ) and it really is clear just like the bottle. It's thick so when you put it on wet hands in the shower it stays there .. it doesn't pour off and go down the drain. I've found that after I massage it in .. I then rinse it off a bit longer than most other brands. This allows that slippery/soapy feeling to subside and the 'clean hair' feeling kick in.  Believe me .. you'll know it when when you feel it! Towel off .. a quick and miserly drop of skinny serum massaged through the fingers then quickly patted on the top of the hair then a minute under a dryer .. and we're all set. Amazingly .. my hair is usually a bit oily the next morning .. but with this it's not. In fact, it looks and feels like I just showered. Needless to say I'm impressed. I only wish that it came in a larger bottle. Give it a shot. You'll love it!"

For it being such a large bottle and using in the shower, it has been a huge pain to open the bottle and bypass the dispenser to squeeze out the product. It gets slippery and I lose a lot of product as well in the process. This has been super disappointing and takes away from the use and enjoyment of the product. Consider changing the apparatus on the bottle that is used to dispense. I bought the conditioner and the shampoo and both dispensers do not work at all and because they do not work, I do not use the product as much."

I finally noticed when I was using it for the first time that it wasn't verified. I saw that the top of the bottle says new richer lather (which you won't see when ordering, seeings how the picture of the shampoo label is not accurate to what they're sending you.) Basically, Amazon is using an outdated, inaccurate picture for their products and I am livid. I am returning this product because I am very unsatisfied that it is not EWG verified.  On a side note, it had a big orange sticker on the back of it, and when I tried to dry the bottle off, it died my towel orange. P.S. I am thirteen and my mother isn't happy either."

I found out long ago doing woodwork that I'm allergic to western red cedar. This product left my scalp with a burning sensation, no doubt due to the cedar oil in the formula. There's a reason bugs won't eat cedar, it's toxic to them. Also, the product is thin and I needed a lot to get my hair clean. My hair was left limp and feeling coated, not at all volumized as advertised. I had great hopes, this company being part of the Hain group but they seem to be trading on the word ""organics"" in their name. I have since found Maple Holistics Degrease shampoo, which does live up to the ""holistics"" in their name. It's great stuff and I won't be buying Avalon Organics products again."

I have long hair that reaches my mid back and it really does not take much shampoo, although the conditioner requires more than others I have used. Great ingredients versus other brands. Volume?

Cleaned and conditioned nicely, within days my hair was looking much nicer and healthier than before, BUT after a few months my hair looked DRAMATICALLY worse than ever, like I was dipping my head in Crisco. Constantly greasy and matted down, like I'd stopped bathing or went on a 6 month hike.

I would literally have itchiness so bad that I would make my own scalp hurt from scratching. But literally after one use the itchiness stopped!

Since I started using this specific line of Head and Shoulders, I haven't had any issues. I'm back to normal. Nothing else worked. I tried other Head & Shoulders products like tree tea oil but didn't do anything. I started using this royal line, shampoo, conditioner, and Instant Soothe Scalp Elixir spray. The spray really helped soothe the very itchy, dry and flaky patches in between washes. As seen by the pictures, after a couple of weeks of using all three products, my dry patches were gone. I now only use the shampoo and conditioner. So grateful for these products. I highly recommend them."

Today I realized that my hair is noticeably thinner where I was applying it (mostly to the top of the head, particularly my bangs and along the part). I guess the thinning could be from the dye job and updos I've been doing, but this thinning hasn't occurred anywhere else on my head but the areas where I've been applying the product, and my lightening/dye is an ombre so it shouldn't affect the roots. I have pretty thick hair, but now I find myself having to take extra care in styling so my scalp doesn't show through.

While the fragrance is lovely, just like it always has been, I would not buy this shampoo again. It seems like a good value, and it is, but it just seems wasteful to have to use so much shampoo to wash my hair one time. This Suave Strawberry Shampoo used to be my go-to shampoo for years.

So I am letting you know that the law allows them to say the formula hasn't changed, even though it has, because the LABEL hasn't changed. I have been trying to.get this law changed at the FDA, that just bc the label doesn't change doesn't mean they get to legally say the formula hasn't changed. It HAS changed!! If you change it you change it. So be warned, the CHEMICAL formula has definitely changed even though the LABEL formula has not. Don't be decieved. The fragrance is HORRIBLE!?!"

At first I thought it was just weird but as we finished the bottle and moved on to the next (I know I’m slow putting 2 and 2 together) I was just thinking it must be the shampoo + conditioner. My husband doesn’t care so he is still using it up. I washed my hair with raw African black soap and did a Apple cider rinse and and after just 1 wash... it was a miracle! I kept talking off my hair tie to my family showing them no hair feel out. I dyed my hair and it felt a little stiff so I washed it with  black soap and used only the Pantene conditioner and  of course my hair fell out. Lesson learned. Skip this product.

The shampoo stripped my hair and made it tangled and usually when that happens it ruins my whole wash day. Just to add in, I usually pre-poo and detangle with heat and heat + detangling makes my hair soft and without tangles. This product really took that feeling away and made it tangled again. Personally, wet and tangled hair does not work for me. I can deal with dry and tangled hair already lol. Honestly, I think this product did clarify my hair and scalp and made it feel very squeaky clean, but I  really like when shampoos having a moisturizing factor with them to make it even more manageable and to not cause setbacks when wash day can be a very long process already. As said before, it didn't work for my hair and it may work for yours. I may try it again actually to see if maybe something went wrong but yea that's just my personal experience."

I was able to apply it just around my roots and it would help remove any oil and dirt that had built up. I typically style my hair every other day or so, applying a heat protector spray and sometimes hairspray - and this was able to wash out a few days worth of products. You only need to use a small amount each time you wash, and as you gradually move to washing every couple of days, the bottle will last you a long time. The smell is nice and light, and not too overpowering. I absolutely love this shampoo and would highly recommend it to others."

I have used expensive shampoos and conditioners for years and this brand by far delivers on keeping hair healthy. I do not wash my hair everyday, and I still use a leave in conditioner and oil on top of this shampoo. But I heat style and blow dry my hair four times a week and it does not feel like straw. This shampoo truely is amazing! Doesn't weigh down my fine hair either like keratin shampoos but still controls frizz."

My hairstylist raved about Davines and highly recommended i give their shampoo and conditioner a try. My hairtype is wavy and thick. It is not super damaged but it is color processed and dehydrated. After giving this shampoo 3 tries… to say im disappointed in an understatement. This product left my hair feeling like straw which no other shampoo has ever done. It did not make my hair feel clean or soft like some other reviewers were stating unfortunately. Its such an expensive bottle and its upsetting that i didn't like the outcome. I did like the conditioner however. I wouldnt spend my money on this product again, far better products out there that are clean and also less harsh chemicals."

I went to a new salon in my new place of residence, and the stylist recommended this shampoo. GAME changer. My extensions are so soft, I use the conditioner ( which I leave in for 5 mins)as well and the mask once in 2 weeks. I wash my hair every 4-5 days and use dry shampoo or baby power in between. It is expensive, but if you have extensions it’s an investment. I had these extensions for 6 months and I can reuse them for 6 more months easily. I used Pantene Moisture for years and it really worked fine on extensions but not in this climate/ water. Highly recommend."

Not as itchy as before. when I part my hair there is no white snow flakes flying everywhere. lol I did follow directions everytime i washed my hair i applied the shampoo 2 to 3 times and leave it for about 3 to 4 minutes. The way I measure my time is by putting music and after 2 to 3 songs I rinse and repeat the process at least 2 times. the shampoo does smell pretty bad, but who cares it does the job ohh and it also kind off drys the hair so make sure to apply a leave on conditioner after. I do it and everything is working out just the way I wanted it to. :) also it arrived on time."

I'm not 100% sure if it were Medicasp that ""cured"" it or if it was in conjunction with a shampoo that comes in a small bottle called Zinc Therapy. I will say though that the main and only important ingredient in Zinc Therapy is Pyrethione Zinc, so you could just buy Head & Shoulders for that chemical ingredient. I bought Medicasp because it's main and only important ingredient is Coal Tar Extract. Like I said not sure if Medicasp ""did it"" or if it were in conjunction or if I was already on my way out or if Medicasp got me there but if you're suffering you're willing to buy relief and I'm glad I bought it and will use it sparingly from here on out as a form of maintenance and prevention."

B01J3BD0M6,2022,1,20,1,5/5 WORTH EVERY PENNY !!!!!!! I PASSED !!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,65 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020",Thomas ,,Verified Purchase,,"I never write reviews for products good or bad , but I had to write one for this product.  Here’s my story: I got a call to come in for a hair follicle test much earlier then I had anticipated.  They called me and on Tuesday and said I had to come in to get the test that same Friday.  So I’m stressing out because I had just smoked that same day and I had been smoking marijuana just about every day for a few months.  I would only smoke once a day though.  I did my research and the results looked pretty bleak.  But the most positive reviews I saw online was for Mike’s Macujo method.  So I did my research and found a YouTube page detailing the process I would have to go through to get my hair clean enough to pass.  In the comments below the video was Mike Macujo’s phone number.  So I called.  I told him how much I had been smoking and the last time I smoked.  He advised I do 8-9 washes over about a weeks time in order to get all of the marijuana out of my hair and pass the test.  But I didn’t have 7 days.  I only had 3 and I didn’t even have the product yet.  He advised me to order this product on amazon and have it overnighted to me and begin the process as soon as possible.  Get as many washes in as I can before my test. (Typically you would have 10 hours between each wash , but because I was pressed for time I washed every 7-8 hours ). I asked if he really thought I could pass in such short time.  He replied yes you would have a good chance of passing.  Now I thought he was just trying to make a quick buck on this expensive product , but he said: “I can guarantee you will fail if you don’t try my method , but if you do use the method exactly like you’re supposed to then you will give yourself a shot “. I wasn’t completely convinced , but I was desperate because this was a once and a life time job opportunity and I had to give it a try.  I bought this product just like he advised and got the rest of the supplies from cvs . And I went through with the cleansing.  I’m not going to lie it burned my scalp, but I felt it working.  When I put the products in my hair the first 2-3 times I could smell marijuana in my hair , and then the last 2-3 times I didn’t smell it anymore.  It was crazy. Although it burned it didn’t do any damage to my hair or scalp.  I had to take the pain of the burn , but it was worth it because it gave me a shot at a great career.  I just found out I passed my hair follicle test and I was amazed. !!!! You will be too. Don’t be discouraged by these negative reviews.  People that say that this method doesn’t work didn’t do it correctly.  If you follow mike’s instructions exactly you WILL pass your test.  Guaranteed.  I was stunned when I got my results. And you will be pleasantly surprised.  Call him he will walk you though everything. Thank you mike ! I wish I can give this product more stars. Wow !"

Got a call from the company that did my hair follicle test and after using this product as the directions showed I failed for thc. I only took 3 hits off a medical marijuana joint about 4 months ago and before that it had been about 4-5 months and only took three of four hits then. All in all about 8-9 hits in last year. I don’t even smoke it casually is what hurts the most and failed the test and lost a 70k year job because this product didn’t hold up to its part of the bargain I would like to call it but no Bargain with a failed result and loss of 180 some dollars paying for it. Should have known when I seen the orange sticker that said absolutely no returns. Funny thing is it didn’t show the coke I did 40 days ago which was the only time in years since I had done it but showed thc that was done much longer back and they say coke is harder to get out. So sad right now. Wanted to get on here before anything else though to warn others

I live in a state were marijuana is legal, I had stopped smoking and was going to just wait the 3 or so month till I knew I'd test clean before starting to look for a new job, because not all employers accept marijuana users. I had only stopped 2 weeks before my old boss reached out and asked if I was ready to come back to work. (I quit my job because i had a baby and wanted to take a year off to be home with her). Its a great job so figured I'd try, I knew they still tested for marijuana so I purchased this kit. I received it on a Friday used it once or twice a day for a week till the following Saturday when I was sent to do my drug test.  Used the ultra clean following the instructions exactly  that's Saturday and went in to do drug test right after hair still went in all. Wednesday I heard back to come in and get processing paper work done. All in all I was clean for about a month before passing my drug test"

When I was looking to purchase I found this miracle. I’ve been using it for about two weeks now. My hair is damaged dry from the bottom and oily from the looks and this has helped it a lot.

She couldn't understand what was wrong when she started using this latest product in a new bottle. It took her a while, trying it over and over again, before she realized that there is something seriously wrong with this shampoo. It seems to have no soap, it leaves her hair feeling flat and greasy. No body at all. Nothing like the way the shampoo has worked for over 10 years. Unfortuantely, by the time she realized the problem was truly the shampoo, and not anything else, it was too late to return the product for a refund. I posted this complaint previously, but it was removed by Amazon because I said that this is either a fake product or Redkin has made an awful change. Amazon checked into the matter and just wrote back to say that they confirmed this is not a fake product. That is why they removed my previous complaint. That is good to know, and I appreciate Amazon getting back to me. That is helpful. But this problem is so severe that it is worth adding this new comment. Unfortunately, as I see it, this leaves only two alternatives: Redkin has ruined the formula so badly that it isn't even close to being the same. Or, perhaps this was just a bad batch. If I don't hear anything back, I will assume it was not a mistake and it is time to find a new brand. If anyone can recommend a substitute, please let me know. Thanks."

Let me first say I have well water, I use heat on my hair and get highlights on my long fine hair so I have some pretty extensive damage. Short of cutting it all off (not ready for that yet) I decided to give it a try after a YouTuber I follow recommended it for my healthier hair journey. I've used A LOT of salon quality shampoos in the past, never being impressed for all the money I fork out on them. My last shampoo purchase was a drugstore brand that I got because it was the most amazing smelling stuff ever and I was tired of spending money and getting the same results. (I know, blasphemy). Finally coming to grips I needed to spend the money and switch back to a better brand if I was ever going to heal my damaged hair, I took the leap. And let me tell you I'm so glad I did. First off, I didn't even mind getting rid of the drug store brand after I used this stuff. Holy heavens to Betsy, it smells amazing! I've been sniffing my hair all day! My hair feels super soft, it's shiny and frizzy split ends are softer and less noticeable. This is after ONE wash y'all. I can't wait to see what it does after 6 months of use, combined with the other changes I'm making for healthier hair. Once I've used it more, I'll leave another updated review about how long the shampoo/conditioner has lasted and how it's helped my hair. I didn't have any close up before pics but I hope this review helps if you're considering buying. As of right now, I highly recommend this product!"

I’ve gone through a lot of different “supposedly will repair your hair” product and this truly works. My new hairdresser noticed the softness immediately after I started using. I’ll probably use this shampoo / conditioner for life.

If you squirt this stuff on your had and try to rinse it off with just water you cant! It leaves a oily residue. I hate to even mention this but I'm getting pimples on my scalp here and there for the first time ever, eeek! This shampoo is getting trashed. In the past I've used pureology and davines with much better results and cleaning. In fact with those shampoo I usually am good for 2 days without my hair needing washed. The conditioner is also not great. It does not make my hair soft and healthy looking and in fact my hair is needing brushed about 5x a day just to stop it from getting nappy! I usually brush my hair in the morning and am good the rest of the day. I just can't believe there are good reviews for this product. Are they getting payed, or did I get a fake product.

I’ve also experimented with many products to keep my violet/purple hair color from fading so quickly but this is my go to shampoo. I put 1/3 of the hair dye my hairstylist uses inside the bottle, shake it before every use, and BOOM you have your own color depositing shampoo that works great. First picture was taken the day I got my hair done from the salon and last picture is after the first wash. As you can see the color still looks great and it doesn’t fade horribly like from other products I’ve used. I recommend using both the shampoo and conditioner and using 1/3 of the color dye, for both bottles, used by your hair stylist to create your own color depositing shampoo and conditioner. I use the Prevana “Violet” Color Enhancer to enhance the purple tones in my hair. I wanted to share my hair wash regiment as I hope it can help your hair color last longer. I naturally have thick and black hair but it gets bleached at the salon so this works great with bleached hair as well.

The pic on the right has my red/purple mix hair 1 month later and the left pic is 3 months later turns into a nice light brown.  The key to keeping the red longer is wash your hair in cold water with good product and I only wash every 3 days.  I also believe it's because the red was mix with purple gives it a nice look as it's faded till your next appoint to the beauty parlor.  I stick my head in cooler water and wash my hair and than I put the conditioner on and put my hair in a bun and let the conditioner sit while I body wash the rest of my body in warm water.  Than I just finish with the cold rise of the conditioner.  Its a few more steps than a normal shower but I'ts worth it to me as I love my hair and by the way I'm 50 years old.

This one, not much at all.  I liked the idea that it was sulfate-free, to protect my color.  I thought it would be gentle and moisturizing.  (I have been using Nexxus Emergencee Shampoo, and that is very moisturizing.)  This just strips my hair.  Even as I am rinsing it out, it immediately is a tangled mess, and feels stripped.  I have a hard time getting my fingers through it as I try and rinse it out.  I really can't comment as to the color preservation abilities of it, as I think I have only used it four times.  I wish I hadn't bought such a big bottle.  It's a lot to just throw away.  I just figured I would like it.  I hate it.  I have to put a lot of conditioner in, about double what I normally use after shampooing, so I can comb through my hair.  I feel like I undo any improvement I have done with the Emergencee shampoo and conditioner.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

At first, I thought this was just my age and changes in hormones. But the change was just too significant, and kindof horrifying. So I finally switched to a natural shampoo and conditioner (which also works really well, has nice scent, and leaves hair soft). And after 1 short week, my hair loss has reduced to normal amounts. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED that I spent over 100$ on this shampoo/conditioner set, and it is HARMFUL to my scalp.

I have very thin hair and it doesn't grow fast at all.  Plus I had weight-loss surgery which can make your hair thinner and I bleach and dye my hair regularly. I am constantly looking for ""the shampoo"" and I think this may be it.  SO the other BIG thing is that my bottles came damaged in shipping.  The pumps snapped at the neck and a decent amount of product leaked all over the box, plus what was left in the bottle I couldn't get out with the broken pump.  I contacted the company and asked if they could just send me new pumps, because I didn't want to send back the shampoo and I felt like the bottles still had a good amount of product left, but they sent me all new replacements without having to return the original order.  They went above and beyond to fix the problem. So I am thrilled with the product and the company."

It's a bit damaged from a lack of trims, swimming, the rare heat styling and I dye it once a year.  I have to use a lot of conditioner (as does my long-haired husband), so a regular conditioner should be affordable.  This amazingly inexpensive conditioner has been the only conditioner that I have consistently good results from, and I've tried salon brands.  It's moisturizing without feeling oily or heavy.  The scent is good, though I find it barely noticeable after showering--which isn't a bad thing, especially when my husband uses it and doesn't want a floral shampoo mixing with his cologne.  My only complaint is the bottle design: I think the different shapes for conditioner and shampoo aren't enough to differentiate.  I once grabbed shampoo in the store while hurried and was so sad when I realized it in the shower!"

I also have battled with psoriasis for 14 years and am unhappy with the shampoo and conditioner I'm currently buying through Function of Beauty, so even though there were a lot of one star reviews, I decided to give this a try. I've used shampoos that left my hair feeling greasy and filmy before, so I was mentally prepared for that and for brushing it to be a struggle. I decided I would give my hair a week to get used to it because I'm sooo over my hair feeling nasty and dry all the time. Anyway, it arrived tonight, and I followed the directions on the back of the bottle: I brushed through my hair before I got in the shower and I let the shampoo sit for five-ish minutes. Also I used a TON of conditioner"

I feel like the people that gave this a bad review did not give it a chance to actually work so I stuck through and kept using it after one week of using the shampoo and conditioner I stopped losing gobs of hair in the shower Before this I even quit washing my hair because I was tired of losing so much hair I really feel that it was the store-bought shampoos that I was using they have shelflife chemicals in them they’re just not good. this shampoo I can honestly say has improved the amount of hair that I was losing in between washes I can also say I am seeing a little bit of hair growth I’m gonna give it like I said three more months to see where were at. Ps. My bf even noticed I wasn’t leaving behind so much hair in the bath anymore and thanked me for finally cleaning it up I laughed told him it’s not me it’s the shampoo but your welcome.🤪😎

Hair no longer feels knotty and waxy after shampooing!,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2021",Smashley,,Verified Purchase,,"Using any shampoo over the last few years causes my hair to feel instantly waxy and become super knotted and tangled. Even after conditioning it still felt like it was covered in build-up or something, I couldn't figure it out. A new hairdresser filling in for my usual stylist figured it out - when I told her what was happening, she asked ""Is there wax in your shampoo?"". Uh, wut? I had NO IDEA there was even wax in shampoo, let alone a brand as good as Redken All Soft. Sure enough, it has dimethyicone! Also, the bottom layers of my hair are also pretty soft and healthy, but the top layer is like a brillo pad - frizzy and dry. She recommended that I use shampoo infused with Keratin and suggested Keratherapy (which she carries in her salon). I used it tonight and now I am a believer!! My hair felt great during and after shampooing - no knots, no awful waxy feeling, just clean and super soft. It smells AMAZING too. I'm sold!! Highly recommended :)"

With this product my hair looked almost freshly washed (the 3 ""after"" photos) and smelled clean too!! I say almost because there's just a tad more shine and a tad more softness to my hair when freshly washed. The smell isn't perfumy or powdery, it's just a clean scent. My hair lasted for about 5ish hours before I needed to pull it back, but even in pulling it back it looked better than it would have without the product.

I bought this straight from Amazon and everything is as expected and a fraction of the price. I definitely love the lather in this shampoo and the scent is a nice, non-synthetic smelling rosemary scent. It smells more like essential oils which tend to have a more powerful scent, but it still isn't overly powerful to me (and everything gives me headaches if it is). I have found the conditioner isn't as moisturizing as it claims to be if your hair is processed or overly processed from lightening or dyeing. I definitely recommend using this in lieu of a deep conditioning treatment. I have chemically lightened hair to platinum and use oVertone coloring conditioner (a semi-permanent fantasy dye) with this and it works great. It doesn't make my fantasy colors bleed too much and keeps them vibrant with the UV protection. Overall a good buy for the price."

I decided about 8 months ago to stop coloring my hair which was brunette with over-all warm highlights. My natural color came in an odd mix of silver, dark grey and very dull, dark brown. So I searched for a shampoo that would subdue the remaining warm brown/blond and blend demarcation line. From online research alone, I decided on Sachajuan Silver. I had never heard of the brand prior to this purchase. I have discovered it not only subdues warm/yellow tints, both in old AND new growth, but is also a great shampoo. A VERY small amount makes huge lather with pleasant, mild scent. I wash my hair almost daily and, thus far, the product has been moisturizing while also adding a little extra volume to my very soft, fine hair. However, I do not use this exclusively, alternating with another old-favorite regular. Going natural process is a pain, but this product has certainly helped me along....although I found a little extra neatness effort was required (for me anyway) when using a dark blue shampoo. Cost is moderately high, but similar to many others with far less to offer. I highly recommend."

If you have faded hilights or bleach, this is your savior. It also works wonders for Grey/silver hair that's turned yellow. You shouldn't use this every time you shampoo, but I do because it makes my fine hair so bouncy and full. What I do is, the first shampoo, I use a conditioning/hydrating shampoo because this will dry your hair out if not careful. The second shampoo, I use the Sacha Juan and leave it on my head for about five minutes while I shave/exfoliate. Then rinse it out, apply conditioner. Since my hair is bleached, I use a hair mask once a week and use a leave-in conditioner every time I get out of the shower so it doesn't dry out.

This shampoo is so full of color, that 1. it does do the job WELL, 2. i'm afraid of using the matching conditioner because i wasn't aiming for lavender hair, and 3. I'm just realizing that it's a little expensive so maybe I should use a regular shampoo and not this one every single day.  I can use whatever other brand shampoo some days but use this when the hair is starting to look like it needs a tone boost.  4.  Its arguably stronger than a toner, which is usually bad for your hair when it contains ammonia or peroxide. When EVER possible, with bleached hair you should use deposit only toners (which is where manic panic's virgin snow comes in).

Just that basic common sense balance we all want of leaving scalp clean and balanced yet length of hair hydrated at same time. This is a simple formula that does just that without endless overbearing fragrances, silicones, suflates, oils, etc and works better for me than any expensive salon line I have tried willing to pay the cost if I had actually seen the results. Great subtle coconut type smell, not sickly sweet and artificial as many cheaper brands often do, and the perfect gel/cream consistency with a gentle lather. Minimal shedding as well which is always the sign of a good formula. No complaints on an impulse buy as have tried about every brand on the planet for my fussy hair and definitely didnt expect to be so impressed with one I had never heard of among at such a low price point. Fab sleek modern packaging as well as a bonus! A+++"

It is very embarrassing and I have looked all over for products that will fix this problem. I read AWESOME reviews about this product- how it has changed peoples greasy hair and how they dont have to wash their hair every single day anymore. I wanted this to work on my hair so bad, but unfortunately, it did not. I could argue that it made my hair even more greasy. My hair did feel more light and clean after showering, but when I woke up the next day, my hair looked very wet and I had to get another shower. I've tried this multiple times and I get the same result- greasier hair the day after. This product works differently for different people, and unfortunately, it did not work for me."

I wanted to try this because it specifically said it was for dark hair and my hairdresser recommended it. I will say this does go on white like other dry shampoos, BUT once you massage it into your scalp or let it sit and absorb all the oils, it disappears. I didn’t find that it left my hair dull either. Dry shampoo can be tricky for some people. I would recommend using it before bed that way it has time to absorb oil over night and you’ll wake up and not have to massage it in or brush it out. Also if you look at some of the pictures people are posting they are literally spraying half the bottle on their head...like of course it’s going to be a thick white powdery mess - You don’t need that much! Spray it where your hair usually looks oily (along your part, maybe an inch or two out from your roots, along your hairline/face).  Again you don’t need a lot!  I like this brand because it smells good, takes care of the oil, and doesn’t leave my hair dull like other dry shampoos. I would highly recommend!"

I really like the scent and this stuff actually makes my hair feel softer than some much more expensive shampoos and conditioners I have used.  I think the key is, don't overuse it - meaning, you are only supposed to wash your hair 2 or 3 times per WEEK. Your hair produces natural oils and if you strip them every day by washing it, it will only start to produce more and cause more and more problems. There will be an adjustment time for sure, but you will thank me after a month! I only use this product about 2 times a week and it is good for me, and will last a really long time."

It doesn't weigh my hair down at all. I just went in for a cut and color touch up yesterday, and my beautician, again, noticed how well my hair is holding the color (with highlights) so well.

It gave me an overall look of nice frizz-free waves without the crunchy feel that most products tend to leave behind once your hair dries.  Quick tip: when you're scrunching your hair, use a towel or tshirt instead of just your hands...you'll see better curls."

After rinsing, I get the faint leather scent I was hoping to smell right off the bat. This scent lasts a good hour after showering. Not as long as Swagger, but this scent is more manly. Think of it as a great cologne you smell at department stores, without burning your nose. Highly recommend this scent if you want something different from Old Spice."

When my wife showered with it I could smell it halfway across the house. I tried it myself and I can still smell it, hours later. The smell is not really to my tastes, since I don't want to smell like grandma. It's sort of like a light perfume meets baby powder scent.

At least not the bottle I got. I read the ingredients on the back of the bottle as compared to the ingredients on the actual Dove website for the same product and they're identical. Not a thing different. This product actually helped soften and clear my skin up! My husband and I have been ordering this same bottle for a year now. My only con is that when water gets inside the bottle it starts to smell like mildew after a little while so I suggest keeping it above and away from where your showerhead sprays or in a cabinet once you're done using it.

        ",Verified Purchase,,"I love this product. My husband somehow goes through a bottle of body wash per week, but with this large size bottle, I don't have to change it out as frequently.  For one, the bottle holds a lot of product, and two, the pump dispenses a normal amount of body wash, minimizing the amount my husband uses.  The scent is a fairly neutral 'clean' scent, so we are both fine using this product. This means one less bottle of product taking up real estate in the shower. As for moisturizing, I still need to follow up with lotion, but my skin definitely feels softer right out of the shower."

Could I pinpoint it as being Jasmine did I not know it was? No, to be honest, but it still smells subtly floral and very Spring-like.  As to how well it moisturizes, it does a good job.

Many soaps can clean your clean off dirt. But, they leave your body dry and chapped. . Dry and chapped skin is considered an opened wound when it comes it viruses and bacteria entering your body. So it’s imperative that  your body is cleaned of all possible  bacteria as well as viruses.  However, if your soap does that, and leaves your skin chapped and/ or extremely dry, you are actually setting yourself up for increased susceptibility to all viruses and bacteria.

It was also shipped well. The pump works, although a little weak/conservative as far as dispensing the product. It does appear to be moisturizing. However the scent is of the synthetic Lilac variety. In fact, a bit perfumy if you ask me. It reminds me of grandma's perfume. It's nothing like actual lavender or even a lavender scent blend. And I don't detect any Chamomile at all. I can't speak as to the Ylang-Ylang, as I've never smelled it before. Although I did Google Ylang-Ylang. Apparently -that- is used in perfumes.

I really enjoyed using products from body shop because they smell amazing, but they are also not very cost-effective (small containers with a substantial price tag for a body wash). I normally don't use Dial products because they dry my skin out, but this particular body wash has just the right mix. It moisturizes, cleans, smells amazing and it is sold at a reasonable and affordable price point. If you have eczema or other skin condition, I can't say that this will be a ""cure"" for that; however, I noticed that my skin did not flare as often.
