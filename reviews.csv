B07NJQ89D5,2022,1,20,2,POOR CHEAP BLUE PUMP ON BOTTLE LEAKS BAD IN SHIPPING,1.0 out of 5 stars,56 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2019",Gerald,,Verified Purchase,,"The product is OK for the money, but the quality of the PUMP is terrible and you will waist allot of product because of it. When you push the Blue Top Pump to get the product out about half of it will come out around the base of the pump head that slides up and down. Amazon really needs to get with the supplier and address this issue. So for that reason and reason alone I give it one Star because it is a mess and you will waist a lot of product which does not make it a great value anymore. Second Order Replacement and it to leaked all over the place, what a mess, no more, asking for refund and not a third replacement."

When I saw the price was around $13-$15 dollars now, I thought that was too expensive. I did some research on Amazon and ran across this product. OMG...I didn‚Äôt realize what I was missing out on. I really like the way my hair feels after washing with this and the scent is awesome. I very much recommend this product to all. I just hope they keep the price down...if so this will be my go to brand!!!"

AWFUL PRODUCT!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,28 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2019",Alexis,,Verified Purchase,,"This product is absolutely horrible. My hair doesn‚Äôt feel clean when I use it and it made my dandruff come back. My hair looks greasy after I shower even though I tried to use triple the amount I usually use to try and get my hair clean using this awful shampoo. DO NOT BUY! It doesn‚Äôt help dandruff at all and it doesn‚Äôt make your hair clean, I tried to save a few bucks buying this but it‚Äôs not worth it at all. Just go with a name brand dandruff shampoo or stick to the one that you use right now that helps. This one is just plain awful and doesn‚Äôt help at all."

I was really hoping it worked as well.  I have dandruff and an itchy scalp more in the colder months and have to use dandruff shampoo for relief.  This smells and looks the same as original head and shoulders but there is no tingling when washing which I like because it immediately brings relief.  It didn't help with my dandruff at all.  I don't know how well it works for everyone but it didn't work for me.

My hair is somehow simultaneously lank & lifeless while also frizzy and brittle. I can‚Äôt figure out if it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not actually cleaning my hair, if it‚Äôs not rinsing out no matter how many times I rinse, or if this is an inherent ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. Do not recommend."

        ",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,Sulfates help create a rich lather but the trade-off is they can be harsh and strip moisture from my hair so I prefer to avoid them and sacrifice the luxurious suds. On that basis alone this shampoo appealed to me but it also includes hyaluronic serum which I have only used in skin care not a hair product so I was curious to see the results. Perhaps if nothing else the hyaluronic acid will help improve the health of my scalp.

Usually I‚Äôm careful about hair products because my hair can weigh down easily. But recently, I had an issue with hair breakage. My strands would seem to snap, leaving little hair pieces in my sink, on my brush, etc. and making my hair look frizzy. My hair stylist recommended a VERY expensive hair care line, which admittedly worked but I did not want to spend so extravagantly on shampoo and conditioner. Then this Dove line came out, so I tried it. Thank God! Not only do I no longer have the breakage problem, my hair feels stronger and improved for a lot less money than the expensive salon line. The breakage problem is gone! This shampoo and conditioner do not weigh down my fine hair and I‚Äôve used them faithfully for several months now. I was excited to see these large bottles available and have them parked in the shower. These products really work for me, and I‚Äôd recommend anyone with hair breakage to try them out."

I have high praise for that.  But it makes my fine, thin, straight  hair super flat and slippery.  It makes my hair so silky that I cannot style it.  I think it would be better for people with hair that is more coarse and has more texture to begin with.  For me it doesn't work."
