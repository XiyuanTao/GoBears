I have a ton of hair, but the actual strands are very fine and when I do my normal wash & air dry routine with this product it just leaves my hair limp & unable to style, it basically makes any natural texture/waves I have dissapear.

As for the product itself, the shampoo didn't work for me. My hair felt drier, built up, and more brittle than my previous shampoo.

Unfortunately, the shampoo is extremely drying, more drying than shampoos not advertized as moisturizing.

Now let me be clear i dont have a bad scalp, i dont get flakes with a natural shampoo. All in all, if you only buy the conditoner and only condition your hair once to AT MOST 3 times a week, its not terrible. But you're better off looking somewhere else anyways, as the ingredients do have drying agents, even though the bittle advertises as moisturizing. Last thing to mention, i dont have dandruff, i have flakes. Dandruff is caused from a fungal diseasr which feeds on the oil of ur scalp. With that being said, it probably makes sense it didnt work for me, and it probably makes sense it dont moisturize. However, the bottle says it does so, misleading."

Have tried other shampoos (at least the ones I'm not allergic to off the bat) and even with only a single washing they make my hair look totally fried and flatter than the proverbial pancake. Never happens with this shampoo. With this one, a single washing with the Awapuhi will resurrect my zombie hair from the walking dead. Not sure how it does that amazing feat but I'm not going to question nor complain! The 33 oz size is fantastic for the budget too.

My thinning and loss of hair, After my research I found that there are too many carcinogens in every day shampoo. I just finished it in July 2018, Yes, I used it 5-6 times a week. You say impossible but it only takes a few drops to do a good lather. Let it remain in your hair a few minutes  before rinsing. My hair loss slowed and then finally became non existent in the first few months to this day. I will never use another hair product. I figured it out to be less than .70 a month. You can't even beat that at a dollar store. 60+ with my own hair."

It lathers and rinses very well, it smells great, and it WORKS!!  So far I have noticed no itching since we switched.  I am very pleased with it!

This is a clarifying shampoo the purpose of it is to clear all product build up and anything else that may damage ur hair. Yes this means it is drying however ur only supposed to use it once a week and follow it up with a conditioner although I highly recommend using a hair mask since hair masks need to be used once a week as well so why not incorporate it into ur routine?. NEVER EVER use this product if u have color treated hair in fact avoid it at all costs. If u use this shampoo more than once a week ur going to run into alot of problems but use it properly and ur going to see a dramatic difference.

I found this at a drug store and love the combo of mint and tea tree so I decided to give it a whirl.  6 months later I'm still using it and loving it, especially for the price!!  No it's not going to perform any hair miracles for you, but it is a lovely product that doesn't make my hair more dry or my scalp more oily.  I love the mild scent in the shower and no lingering aromas afterward.  My husband loves that it's a unisex fragrance that he can use too!  I bought both the shampoo and the condition as add on items and they're cheaper on Amazon than at Walmart that way.  Can't beat $4 (each) for a good shampoo and a good conditioner!

A lot of people think of peppermint as only something that is used during the winter, right before Christmas, perhaps, but this find is actually appropriate year-round. Use it in the winter when a combination of lack of humidity and the cold air will leave hair lifeless and dull from weather stress, and bring it back in summer to tame headaches and ease the tension in your neck after a long day at work. Lather, let it it sit, and then convince yourself to rinse away the tingle that comes from this shampoo. The tea tree oil will help keep dandruff at bay, and the peppermint makes your hair so soft! Used by beauticians everywhere. Once you experience the minty tingle, you won't want anything else to touch your tresses, so it's a good thing they have a conditioner that complements, down to being the same composition in a moisturizing, soothing formula. Fall in love, as I did."

This shampoo, man of man, I could feel my hair reacting too it as I put it in. One use and I was like, well I've found my new shampoo for life. Due to the pandemic, shampoo and conditioner is hard to come by in store so I tried Amazon and I chose this specific conditioner because I already knew I liked Hello Hydration by them, and they were both coconut so I figured they'd be similar.

It lathers very well and smells nice. I did not use any conditioner after, and my hair is soft and tangle free. I have natural grey hair that is rather dry at the ends, and this helps tame the ends.  In addition, I flat iron my hair. With Olaplex, my hair is already more smooth after the treatment and shampoo, so when I flat iron, I don't need to spend as much time with the iron! Even two days after treatment and styling, my hair is still soft and flowing. Together with Olaplex No. 3, I am already seeing the difference in my hair, and I am happy. Grey hair is not easy to tame, so I have tried many products. Olaplex is the solution I have been waiting for."

So I‚Äôve never purchased Redkin Allsoft before, so I can‚Äôt speak to this formula‚Äôs authenticity, however I can say it has made my hair gorgeous! I love love LOVE the feel this has given my hair. I had fried my hair with years of bleaching it and decided to dye it my natural color and let it grow. My hair had been looking so harsh and dried out, but once I started using this, from the very first use it became much more soft and manageable. I will admit, The first week my scalp did get quite a few pimples along the hair line, but I have very sensitive skin so any changes to my routine usually causes breakouts. So maybe those that are complaining have not given their skin enough time to adapt to the change. I think the scent is perfect, and smells just like the salon quality stuff. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and use Biosilk before drying my hair and my hair has never been softer."

I was so close to just doing a pixie cut and not worrying about any of it, when I tried this, and now my hair is actually enjoyable to have long.

My hair is wavy caucasian hair and although I like hair care to be somewhat moisturizing and not stripping, this was FAR too greasy and heavy. I matched my hair type on their website to their suggestions and ordered this for me to use and for my teen daughter with loose curly hair. I wish I could give it 5 starts, because the ingredients are much safer than most other shampoos, but I can't because it is NOT good for typical caucasian hair in my opinion. People with dry curls may like it and it likely is great for those that want a REALLY HEAVY THICK moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it was so thick that my daughter's hair looked about 3 shades darker until she rewashed it with Acure (which we've used for the past few years)."

This shampoo left my hair soft yet product-free after just one wash. My hair is noticeably softer, and any trace of greasiness is gone. It doesn't strip everything off to the point that my hair feels totally de-oiled and dried out, like it would after using the stripping shampoo. The only potential drawback for some people might be that it doesn't have a strong pleasant scent that I have noticed with other Nexxus products. Rather, it has a very light scent that reminds me of incense. I use a conditioner from Nexxus that smells of coconuts after using this product, but that's just personal preference.

I used as directed and it turned my hair into a greasy or dry frizz bomb every time I used the combo.  Even when I put after shower products in.  No shampoo and conditioner combo has ever done this to me and when you look at the ingredient list it's horrifying too.  Most hair dressers in fact would not recommend.  I bought this because it was on the cheaper side but since this is your hair we are talking about it might be better of spending more money.  I can only imagine how damaged my hair would be if I continued use.  I do not recommend purchasing.

As for the product itself, the shampoo didn't work for me. My hair felt drier, built up, and more brittle than my previous shampoo. I won't knock it for that because I know not all products work for everyone.

Couple of observations. Pump is difficult to use - need to physically raise pump after depressing, and each pump doesn't deliver enough shampoo. Shampoo doesn't lather that well - I have short hair and need 3-4 pumps to get my hair lather well. Seems like with other brands, I could use half the amount of shampoo. Scent was not to my liking, but this might just be my preference. It has a strong smell of banana, which I severely dislike. My hair feels dry and not moisturized at all. Overall, pretty disappointed with the product. I went from a brand that costs about 1/2 the amount and I felt like my hair felt better with that brand, which I'll likely go back to."

I have very bushy, wild, hair that I‚Äôve always put up in a bun because straightening takes too long and doesn‚Äôt even last a whole day. The first time I used it I left my hair down and let it air dry. When my boyfriend came home from work he asked me where I was going...I was confused because I hadn‚Äôt planned to go anywhere. He said my hair looked very nice and he knew me well enough to know I don‚Äôt ever style my hair so I must have been getting ready to go out. I went to look in the mirror and I was shocked. My normally unorganized curly frizz actually had formed into perfect ringlet curls all over. And as any curly haired girl will know, with the lesser brands you have to use so much to get the tangles out, but if you cross the fine line to too much you end up with a greasy look. With this stuff I only use 1 pump of shampoo, and 1 1/2 pumps of condition. It lasts me so much longer than the cheaper brands, so even though it costs more up front, you don‚Äôt have to buy as often which means over time you don‚Äôt really pay much more than for the cheap stuff.

The 11 oz. boldly states that the shampoo is SULFATE FREE, but for whatever ""reason"" the 32 oz. is NOT - it contains sodium coco-sulfate.

I contacted the manufacturer's consumer hotline and asked if the formula had been changed or if the product was now thinner - there really wasn't an answer, however, I was offered a discount coupon ($12 as I'd purchased the 32 oz size).

Even in the shower I could feel it becoming sticky and tangled. I had to apply massive amounts of hair conditioner in order to get my hair back to normal and blow it out.

I wanted to splurge on my hair and give myself the best hair color protectant and nourisher. I have now used this product for several months. The scent of the shampoo is refreshing, and the conditioner makes my hair feel very soft and combable. HOWEVER, my hair started to fall out in bunches!! At first, I thought this was just my age and changes in hormones. But the change was just too significant, and kindof horrifying. So I finally switched to a natural shampoo and conditioner (which also works really well, has nice scent, and leaves hair soft). And after 1 short week, my hair loss has reduced to normal amounts. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED that I spent over 100$ on this shampoo/conditioner set, and it is HARMFUL to my scalp. Now I pretty much have to throw it away, because I wouldn't gift hairloss to anyone I like."

My doctor thought it was fungus and had a medicated shampoo but once I finished the shampoo it started again and I realized it was just really really bad dandruff. Since I started using this specific line of Head and Shoulders, I haven't had any issues. I'm back to normal. Nothing else worked. I tried other Head & Shoulders products like tree tea oil but didn't do anything. I started using this royal line, shampoo, conditioner, and Instant Soothe Scalp Elixir spray. The spray really helped soothe the very itchy, dry and flaky patches in between washes. As seen by the pictures, after a couple of weeks of using all three products, my dry patches were gone. I now only use the shampoo and conditioner. So grateful for these products. I highly recommend them."

My suggestion is to have a tight sticky foil or cardboard paper glued to the bottle opening so it does not leak.  My bottle did leak but not to bad of a mess.  I had to clean it up, my counter and the outside of the bottle.  It didn't lose to much shampoo but that can be prevented with a sealed tab on the bottle opening.  I am not sending back the shampoo.  It may have lost maybe 2 tsp. fulls of shampoo.  So I am making a suggestion.  This is my favorite shampoo on the market.  Great Price."

After using the shampoo for over a week, I could tell my hair felt thicker and had more volume. The shampoo was gentle on my scalp and did not dry it out like similar products that I have used. To be honest I am also using this alongside their hair pills, which is how I came to find out about this shampoo. If you have thinning hair and need a shampoo that smells great, gentle on your scalp and actually works - this is the product for you. The only thing they need to improve is to have this in a bigger bottle instead of two small bottles, which is a waste of plastic and creates extra waste for the environment."

I have to admit that this shampoo (combined with an amazing protein conditioner) has reduced the hair breakage of my natural hair. After the 3rd wash it doesn't suds up as much so you will need a clarifying shampoo to get excess oil buildup off, but for African american hair, this definitely retains moisture. Its also with noting that this shampoo (plus a protein conditioner) has reduced the amount of heat i need for flat ironing.

I'm pretty sure this larger 33.8 oz bottle (which was a deal at $19.30) was watered down/cut with a lower-quality shampoo, though.  Like I said, I've been using it for years, and this bottle *did not* smell the same.  It also didn't lather as well, nor did it moisturize as well.  Hence the 1 star.

It won‚Äôt strip the heck out if your hair like a clarifying shampoo. I have their volumizing one Too! Though it smells great not as great as this one, but it‚Äôs a lighter formula in that it literally feels lighter and hair is lifted but also without stripping it. I love their conditioner but I keep a tub of biolage matrix hydrating conditioner for those rare occasions I need it after heavy styling like a roller set teasing and lots of hair spray and dusting powder for an updo for example, or when my hair feels dry. I don‚Äôt use a clarifying shampoo in those cases or the volumizing one I just wash twice! I use volumizing shampoo when I feel my hair is too hydrated and needs protein.

I matched my hair type on their website to their suggestions and ordered this for me to use and for my teen daughter with loose curly hair. I wish I could give it 5 starts, because the ingredients are much safer than most other shampoos, but I can't because it is NOT good for typical caucasian hair in my opinion.

I even will shampoo my hair 2 or sometimes  times very thoroughly, but my hair still is grimey feeling underneath! I'm so dissappointed because I love everything else about this shampoo and conditioner. But I have to use to much of the shampoo every time, and it doesn't even clean my hair properly.

I have an in-store purchased bottle of extra strengh, and I have the bottle I received through amazon, they are the same. Also the seller is OGX themselves, not a third party. You may not like it in comparison to the original, I personally do (I wouldn't have purchased it again if I didn't like it!) Both formulas have pros and cons, and I prefer extra strengh. I think it works great. Give it a try, it might work for you. I mostly wanted to post this review to help clear up the misconception that this is a fake. It's real."

I even resorted to using Head & Shoulders, even though I've not had any flaking, just to try to reduce some of the gunk on my scalp. So I won't be ordering this again.

I could be wrong, but I‚Äôve been using this shampoo for so long with rarely any other shampoo brands in between since this is my go-to shampoo. I used it all and my hair did get the benefits from it, but not as soft as it would have been with previous shampoo bottles bought from store.

I followed with the conditioner, and it softened the hair in the shower a bit. After blow drying, although it looks shiny at the root, it is wispy and brittle looking.

There was one review saying that it burned her scalp and another that said it burns their eyes - that's probably why. Salt will strip your hair color out, dehydrate your hair and certainly strip down any keratin or Brazilian treatments in your hair. If the manufacturer could reformulate this to be salt (sodium chloride) free, now THAT would be a winner üåüüôè. I'm giving it 3 stars because it is SLS free. That's a good start, but what you gain in removing harsh surfactants, you lose in adding sodium chloride. I hope the manufacturer's will consider reformulating this product without salt."

It is very strong so my advice to you is ""less is more"". What I mean is if you are using it for the first time and don't know how long to keep it on, choose the lesser time. For example, I left the product on for 3 minutes the first time. It definitely toned down the brassiness in my hair, but it wasn't quite the silver color I was trying to achieve. I waited a few days and a couple of shampoos later, I tried again and left it on for about 6 minutes and there was quite a bit of silver tone to it. So, it really depends on what color you are trying to achieve. I am trying to stay current with the silvery blonde look that seems to be in now. I am very happy with this product and I hope more people in the US find out about it. NOTE: The picture where I‚Äôm wearing the black sweatshirt is the before shot.

I've never written an Amazon review in my entire life and I probably won't ever again, but I gotta share this in case there's someone out there who it can help. This shampoo saved my god damn head. Literally. Within the past month, I've spent over $100 on shampoos trying to fix an issue I've been experiencing with my hair. I have very thick, oily, and heavy hair that after about 12 hours, feels greasy (and sometimes looks it too). About a month ago I realized I wasn't able to fully wash product out of my head even when using just a little bit and washing it out for 30+ minutes. Every single day after drying my hair for over an hour, I'd find a clump of shampoo/conditioner stuck in the back of my head. I couldn't get this out no matter what treatments I did, no matter what product I used, etc. I went through multiple bottles and brands of shampoos and none of it worked. I then came across this product and bought it as my last hope. I washed with this shampoo two days in a row and my hair no longer has left over product it, it stays soft and light for over 24 hours now, and I can't say enough good things about the consistency and sent of the product itself. If you've experienced any issues like I've had above, I kid you not this shampoo is worth every dollar. If I had just bought this shampoo in the first place I would've saved myself over $100.

I‚Äôve been a Biolage user for years. I always used the shampoo and conditioner for colored hair, even though I didn‚Äôt color my hair all the time, maybe once a year on a whim. That always worked well for me. I decided to try the micro oil shampoo/conditioner, because I felt like my scalp was getting too dry. That was unfortunately a mistake. This caused a lot of build up of product on my scalp and my hair to be so greasy! I did make sure I rinsed aggressively to get all the product out, and I only us conditioner on my scalp once a week. That being said, the conditioner worked great for my ends. I decided I needed a scalp reset so I bought this shampoo, and it‚Äôs been a world of difference! My hair gets squeaky clean but I don‚Äôt have a dry scalp! I have noticed my ends looking a little ragged, but I also haven‚Äôt gotten my hair cut in almost a year. I‚Äôm going to start focusing on using less shampoo and only at the scalp, and doing deep treatments on my ends. Regardless I love this shampoo and it‚Äôs my new regular.

I scrub it into my scalp in the shower, wait 2-3 minutes before rinsing, and then only put conditioner from the middle to the ends of my hair. Doing this before blow drying and styling makes my hair last 2 days usually (sometimes I can even pull off 3), instead of less than 1.

About a week and a half later I noticed my head getting more and more itchy and the ends of my hair getting SUPER dry, I thought the itching was just allergies (as I'm sensitive to certain perfumes) until I realized it would be the worst right after a shower as my hair was drying. Then I realized my scalp was chemically burned (as well as my hair hence the ""dry"" ends) and immediately discontinued using the shampoo. I had an extra bottle of Aussie awesome volumizing shampoo I used instead and within a few days I had no symptoms whatsoever and my hair is back to having moisture.

I thought it was so promising when I first pumped out the shampoo as the consistency was so thick and creamy, but once I lathered my hair, I could feel my hair getting stripped of its natural oils immediately. I mistakenly bought the largest bottle and spent too much money on it, thinking it was going to be worth it based on all the positive reviews.

Unfortunately, the shampoo is extremely drying, more drying than shampoos not advertized as moisturizing.

Now let me be clear i dont have a bad scalp, i dont get flakes with a natural shampoo. All in all, if you only buy the conditoner and only condition your hair once to AT MOST 3 times a week, its not terrible. But you're better off looking somewhere else anyways, as the ingredients do have drying agents, even though the bittle advertises as moisturizing. Last thing to mention, i dont have dandruff, i have flakes. Dandruff is caused from a fungal diseasr which feeds on the oil of ur scalp. With that being said, it probably makes sense it didnt work for me, and it probably makes sense it dont moisturize. However, the bottle says it does so, misleading."

My hair was brittle and seemed always dry no matter what products I would put on it. I thought that I would have had to cut my hair and start completely over. However, when my products arrived, I could not wait to give them a try. I love the smells. Very nice and not powerful. I washed my hair twice with the Nexxus Shampoo, first time just the scalp, and the second wash, the hair itself. The way that my hair reacted to this shampoo was breathtaking! My curls appeared and believe it or not, I was able to pull a comb through my thick, natural, 4C  hair!! I have never, ever been able to do this before while washing. Barely any hair was coming out in my comb! I had not even used the conditioner yet. I just had to stop and look in the mirror and talk to myself saying, ""Omg, I cannot believe this""! I have never, ever experienced a shampoo doing my hair like this before. After I completely rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I moved on to the Nexxus Conditioner. Even more amazing. It stated to leave on the hair for 3 min, but I sat under a hooded dryer for about 10min with the conditioner on my hair, under a plastic cap. Once my time was up, I rinsed away all of the conditioner. My hair was so manageable!! I was able to comb and section it to do my bantu knots and allow my hair to dry overnight. After washing my hair, it only took me about 30 min to get it  all done to dry. I have never been able to complete this process this quickly before! I am highly satisfied with these products! Even though they are  expensive products, I'm hooked and will be purchasing again. I told my mom about my experience and am ready to try it on her hair also, to see if she gets the same experience and satisfaction that I got. Thank you Nexxus for such wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them. Definitely a must try on the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner for Severely damaged hair. This is my first time ever writing a review on a product. That's how pleased I was with these products!!"

Out of the hundreds of samples received throughout the years, this was the first product I was compelled to buy. My hair was dry and lifeless. This shampoo/conditioner makes my hair shiny and so soft. I've used more shampoos than I can count and this is the first to give me noticeable results after just one use. I will say that if you are sensitive to perfume smells, this may be too strong for you. I enjoy the sent and the fact that my hair holds that sent beyond 24 hours. Even after using a different shampoo for a day, the smell of this one still comes through. Also, if you are prone to greasy hair, this may make it worse. I do not have this issue typically, but at the end of the day after using this, there is a subtle heaviness to my roots. All of this being said, this is my new favorite beauty product."

I do have thin hair so this is a concern. However what you need to know is that as soon as you put the conditioner on that feeling disappears so make sure you condition all the way to your roots. I know that‚Äôs typically not recommended but I believe this shampoo and conditioner are made to treat and repair the entire hair strand. Also, it smells amazing. The thing I would compare the smell to is the Moroccan hair treatment oils that are out there. Very pleasant and it lasts after styling which I like because I love to smell good! If you‚Äôre unsure whether you‚Äôll like this shampoo then buy the smaller bottles first. And remember to use the shampoo and conditioner together and your hair will turn out smooth and shiny!"

My hair had been looking so harsh and dried out, but once I started using this, from the very first use it became much more soft and manageable. I will admit, The first week my scalp did get quite a few pimples along the hair line, but I have very sensitive skin so any changes to my routine usually causes breakouts. So maybe those that are complaining have not given their skin enough time to adapt to the change. I think the scent is perfect, and smells just like the salon quality stuff.

After few washes my ash blonde gets warmer and brassy tones appear in the crown area (I used to be a much lighter blonde, so the color washes out quite quickly from my hair). Purple shampoos do not work for me cause they bring out the brassy reds. I was looking for something that will extend my dark blonde and keep the undertone cooler. This shampoo did it for me. I keep it on for 5-10 mins (depending on the intensity I need) and it actually works, it gives a caramel hue to where I would previously get brassy tones. I started using the matching conditioner too. The only down side is it does dry my hair, so I have to moisturize with pre wash balm and use a mask every time after I wash, plus the serum before drying."

Let me first say I have well water, I use heat on my hair and get highlights on my long fine hair so I have some pretty extensive damage. Short of cutting it all off (not ready for that yet) I decided to give it a try after a YouTuber I follow recommended it for my healthier hair journey. I've used A LOT of salon quality shampoos in the past, never being impressed for all the money I fork out on them. My last shampoo purchase was a drugstore brand that I got because it was the most amazing smelling stuff ever and I was tired of spending money and getting the same results. (I know, blasphemy). Finally coming to grips I needed to spend the money and switch back to a better brand if I was ever going to heal my damaged hair, I took the leap. And let me tell you I'm so glad I did. First off, I didn't even mind getting rid of the drug store brand after I used this stuff. Holy heavens to Betsy, it smells amazing! I've been sniffing my hair all day! My hair feels super soft, it's shiny and frizzy split ends are softer and less noticeable. This is after ONE wash y'all. I can't wait to see what it does after 6 months of use, combined with the other changes I'm making for healthier hair. Once I've used it more, I'll leave another updated review about how long the shampoo/conditioner has lasted and how it's helped my hair.

I naturally have very oily hair (2b wavy). But this stuff has changed my mind! It provides just the right amount of moisture. My hair is so incredibly soft yet it isn't weighed down or oily. I'm so happy I found this! Finally my hair feels healthy after years of using drying shampoos to get rid of the oily hair. All it took was a few weeks of doing the complete opposite :) The smell is not my favorite, but it's not the worst and you can't really smell it after washing. Smells more like a weird cherry cough syrup to me. But it's worth it to get this hair!"

With this particular Nexxus I'm a believer. I'm getting to an age where my hair is starting to thin a bit on the top so I want to make what's left up there look as full and shiny as possible. I've tried a bunch of shampoos that leave my mane either flat and greasy (as in the case of moisturizing shampoos) or dry as a bone and staticy once I blow dry it (as in the case of most clarifying shampoos) but this version of Nexxus hit's the sweet spot. It has a subtle fragrance that's sophisticated yet very low key (it smells expensive but quietly so  .. ) and it really is clear just like the bottle. It's thick so when you put it on wet hands in the shower it stays there .. it doesn't pour off and go down the drain. I've found that after I massage it in .. I then rinse it off a bit longer than most other brands. This allows that slippery/soapy feeling to subside and the 'clean hair' feeling kick in.  Believe me .. you'll know it when when you feel it! Towel off .. a quick and miserly drop of skinny serum massaged through the fingers then quickly patted on the top of the hair then a minute under a dryer .. and we're all set. Amazingly .. my hair is usually a bit oily the next morning .. but with this it's not. In fact, it looks and feels like I just showered. Needless to say I'm impressed. I only wish that it came in a larger bottle. Give it a shot. You'll love it!"

I found out long ago doing woodwork that I'm allergic to western red cedar. This product left my scalp with a burning sensation, no doubt due to the cedar oil in the formula. There's a reason bugs won't eat cedar, it's toxic to them. Also, the product is thin and I needed a lot to get my hair clean. My hair was left limp and feeling coated, not at all volumized as advertised. I had great hopes, this company being part of the Hain group but they seem to be trading on the word ""organics"" in their name.

This version dries my hair  and I feel I need conditioner  after but in fear of oily hair I dont use it. I have  natural  oily thick hair  and so far I'm okay with this shampoo better than the stinky smelly one and I have not had any flare ups ."

I could still smell it weeks later just by walking into my bathroom. The sulfur (or as a previous reviewer said, sewer) odor became more pronounced when actually taking a shower...

Used it for about a week, about 4/7 days (not continuous). Today I realized that my hair is noticeably thinner where I was applying it (mostly to the top of the head, particularly my bangs and along the part). I guess the thinning could be from the dye job and updos I've been doing, but this thinning hasn't occurred anywhere else on my head but the areas where I've been applying the product, and my lightening/dye is an ombre so it shouldn't affect the roots. I have pretty thick hair, but now I find myself having to take extra care in styling so my scalp doesn't show through.

And I have tried many drug store and professional brands- none come close to this one. Doesn‚Äôt leave a strong scent making it obvious that you used dry shampoo and it leaves your hair feeling like it‚Äôs been shampooed!! No gunky weird textures!! It does have a slight pretty soft scent when you first spray it but then it goes away pretty quick. I actually love the scent haha so I don‚Äôt mind it at all!! Love love love. Definitely one of the best investments I have ever made. I know it‚Äôs expensive but trust me it is WORTH IT

It makes your hair smell horrible and it doesn't even wash the same.  It barely lathers, makes my hair feel like straw when wet and dry.  This was the only shampoo I've used for the past 10 years on a regular basis and now I don't know what I'm going to use. The original made my hair so soft and my curls so bouncy and shiny.  Why in the world would Suave change the formula so drastically?  It's truly horrible and even worse, makes my hair smell like sour vinegar and sweat."

I have not used it for awhile now and it just seems to me that the shampoo's formula is not the same as it used to be. When shampooing my hair, I had to keep adding more and more shampoo just to get a lather going. The amount of shampoo that I ended up using was just ridiculous (about 3/4 of an inch's worth). While the fragrance is lovely, just like it always has been, I would not buy this shampoo again. It seems like a good value, and it is, but it just seems wasteful to have to use so much shampoo to wash my hair one time. This Suave Strawberry Shampoo used to be my go-to shampoo for years. I would buy nothing else but this shampoo. However, I will probably end up donating the 12 bottles that I bought to some charity. You really do get what you pay for."

The fragrance now has peach and musk added to the strawberry which makes it super strong and weird smelling and is NOT the mild strawberry it use to be. The reason they can legally say that the formula hasn't changed is because on the label, the fragrance change still gets to be on the label as ""fragrance."" That is the dishonest and misleading problem of my profession. So I am letting you know that the law allows them to say the formula hasn't changed, even though it has, because the LABEL hasn't changed. I have been trying to.get this law changed at the FDA, that just bc the label doesn't change doesn't mean they get to legally say the formula hasn't changed. It HAS changed!! If you change it you change it. So be warned, the CHEMICAL formula has definitely changed even though the LABEL formula has not. Don't be decieved. The fragrance is HORRIBLE!?!"

The shampoo stripped my hair and made it tangled and usually when that happens it ruins my whole wash day. Just to add in, I usually pre-poo and detangle with heat and heat + detangling makes my hair soft and without tangles. This product really took that feeling away and made it tangled again. Personally, wet and tangled hair does not work for me. I can deal with dry and tangled hair already lol. Honestly, I think this product did clarify my hair and scalp and made it feel very squeaky clean, but I  really like when shampoos having a moisturizing factor with them to make it even more manageable and to not cause setbacks when wash day can be a very long process already. As said before, it didn't work for my hair and it may work for yours. I may try it again actually to see if maybe something went wrong but yea that's just my personal experience."

I first purchased it along with the conditioner at my salon and loved how soft it left my hair. It does lather decently. I'm always a little hesitant buying hair products on Amazon due to the complaints from people claiming they received fake/counterfeit hair products but I did compare this one to the salon bought one and it looks and smells exactly the same. This shampoo and conditioner really helps my very processed and over worked hair. I will definitely continue to use products from this line. It is a bit pricey but I feel it has really helped save my hair from breaking off and splitting. It's worked much better then some other top of the line products I've tried like, Alterna, Matrix and TIGI. None of those brands really helped moisturize and soften my hair. This brand has worked much better and I will stick with it."

I used to be one of those people who used shampoo and conditioner every day. This shampoo was amazing and helped me transition to washing my hair 1-2 times a week now! I was able to apply it just around my roots and it would help remove any oil and dirt that had built up. I typically style my hair every other day or so, applying a heat protector spray and sometimes hairspray - and this was able to wash out a few days worth of products. You only need to use a small amount each time you wash, and as you gradually move to washing every couple of days, the bottle will last you a long time. The smell is nice and light, and not too overpowering. I absolutely love this shampoo and would highly recommend it to others."

The way I measure my time is by putting music and after 2 to 3 songs I rinse and repeat the process at least 2 times. the shampoo does smell pretty bad, but who cares it does the job ohh and it also kind off drys the hair so make sure to apply a leave on conditioner after.

I will say though that the main and only important ingredient in Zinc Therapy is Pyrethione Zinc, so you could just buy Head & Shoulders for that chemical ingredient. I bought Medicasp because it's main and only important ingredient is Coal Tar Extract. Like I said not sure if Medicasp ""did it"" or if it were in conjunction or if I was already on my way out or if Medicasp got me there but if you're suffering you're willing to buy relief and I'm glad I bought it and will use it sparingly from here on out as a form of maintenance and prevention."

I PASSED !!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,65 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020",Thomas ,,Verified Purchase,,"I never write reviews for products good or bad , but I had to write one for this product.  Here‚Äôs my story: I got a call to come in for a hair follicle test much earlier then I had anticipated.  They called me and on Tuesday and said I had to come in to get the test that same Friday.  So I‚Äôm stressing out because I had just smoked that same day and I had been smoking marijuana just about every day for a few months.  I would only smoke once a day though.  I did my research and the results looked pretty bleak.  But the most positive reviews I saw online was for Mike‚Äôs Macujo method.  So I did my research and found a YouTube page detailing the process I would have to go through to get my hair clean enough to pass.  In the comments below the video was Mike Macujo‚Äôs phone number.  So I called.  I told him how much I had been smoking and the last time I smoked.  He advised I do 8-9 washes over about a weeks time in order to get all of the marijuana out of my hair and pass the test.  But I didn‚Äôt have 7 days.  I only had 3 and I didn‚Äôt even have the product yet.  He advised me to order this product on amazon and have it overnighted to me and begin the process as soon as possible.  Get as many washes in as I can before my test. (Typically you would have 10 hours between each wash , but because I was pressed for time I washed every 7-8 hours ). I asked if he really thought I could pass in such short time.  He replied yes you would have a good chance of passing.  Now I thought he was just trying to make a quick buck on this expensive product , but he said: ‚ÄúI can guarantee you will fail if you don‚Äôt try my method , but if you do use the method exactly like you‚Äôre supposed to then you will give yourself a shot ‚Äú. I wasn‚Äôt completely convinced , but I was desperate because this was a once and a life time job opportunity and I had to give it a try.  I bought this product just like he advised and got the rest of the supplies from cvs . And I went through with the cleansing.  I‚Äôm not going to lie it burned my scalp, but I felt it working.  When I put the products in my hair the first 2-3 times I could smell marijuana in my hair , and then the last 2-3 times I didn‚Äôt smell it anymore.  It was crazy. Although it burned it didn‚Äôt do any damage to my hair or scalp.  I had to take the pain of the burn , but it was worth it because it gave me a shot at a great career.  I just found out I passed my hair follicle test and I was amazed. !!!! You will be too. Don‚Äôt be discouraged by these negative reviews.  People that say that this method doesn‚Äôt work didn‚Äôt do it correctly.  If you follow mike‚Äôs instructions exactly you WILL pass your test.  Guaranteed.  I was stunned when I got my results. And you will be pleasantly surprised.  Call him he will walk you though everything. Thank you mike ! I wish I can give this product more stars. Wow !"

Much worse.,1.0 out of 5 stars,16 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2021",Doug M.,,Verified Purchase,,"My wife has been using this Redkin shampoo for over 10 years. She couldn't understand what was wrong when she started using this latest product in a new bottle. It took her a while, trying it over and over again, before she realized that there is something seriously wrong with this shampoo. It seems to have no soap, it leaves her hair feeling flat and greasy. No body at all. Nothing like the way the shampoo has worked for over 10 years. Unfortuantely, by the time she realized the problem was truly the shampoo, and not anything else, it was too late to return the product for a refund. I posted this complaint previously, but it was removed by Amazon because I said that this is either a fake product or Redkin has made an awful change. Amazon checked into the matter and just wrote back to say that they confirmed this is not a fake product. That is why they removed my previous complaint. That is good to know, and I appreciate Amazon getting back to me. That is helpful. But this problem is so severe that it is worth adding this new comment. Unfortunately, as I see it, this leaves only two alternatives: Redkin has ruined the formula so badly that it isn't even close to being the same. Or, perhaps this was just a bad batch. If I don't hear anything back, I will assume it was not a mistake and it is time to find a new brand. If anyone can recommend a substitute, please let me know. Thanks."

It smelled like a perm.  It made me gag it was so strong.  I attempted to use it again figuring it may have been a fluke but the smell remains.  This must be fake or extremely expired.

Let me first say I have well water, I use heat on my hair and get highlights on my long fine hair so I have some pretty extensive damage. Short of cutting it all off (not ready for that yet) I decided to give it a try after a YouTuber I follow recommended it for my healthier hair journey. I've used A LOT of salon quality shampoos in the past, never being impressed for all the money I fork out on them. My last shampoo purchase was a drugstore brand that I got because it was the most amazing smelling stuff ever and I was tired of spending money and getting the same results. (I know, blasphemy). Finally coming to grips I needed to spend the money and switch back to a better brand if I was ever going to heal my damaged hair, I took the leap. And let me tell you I'm so glad I did. First off, I didn't even mind getting rid of the drug store brand after I used this stuff. Holy heavens to Betsy, it smells amazing! I've been sniffing my hair all day! My hair feels super soft, it's shiny and frizzy split ends are softer and less noticeable. This is after ONE wash y'all. I can't wait to see what it does after 6 months of use, combined with the other changes I'm making for healthier hair. Once I've used it more, I'll leave another updated review about how long the shampoo/conditioner has lasted and how it's helped my hair. I didn't have any close up before pics but I hope this review helps if you're considering buying. As of right now, I highly recommend this product!"

In the past I've used pureology and davines with much better results and cleaning. In fact with those shampoo I usually am good for 2 days without my hair needing washed. The conditioner is also not great. It does not make my hair soft and healthy looking and in fact my hair is needing brushed about 5x a day just to stop it from getting nappy!

First picture was taken the day I got my hair done from the salon and last picture is after the first wash. As you can see the color still looks great and it doesn‚Äôt fade horribly like from other products I‚Äôve used. I recommend using both the shampoo and conditioner and using 1/3 of the color dye, for both bottles, used by your hair stylist to create your own color depositing shampoo and conditioner. I use the Prevana ‚ÄúViolet‚Äù Color Enhancer to enhance the purple tones in my hair. I wanted to share my hair wash regiment as I hope it can help your hair color last longer. I naturally have thick and black hair but it gets bleached at the salon so this works great with bleached hair as well.

The pic on the right has my red/purple mix hair 1 month later and the left pic is 3 months later turns into a nice light brown.  The key to keeping the red longer is wash your hair in cold water with good product and I only wash every 3 days.  I also believe it's because the red was mix with purple gives it a nice look as it's faded till your next appoint to the beauty parlor.  I stick my head in cooler water and wash my hair and than I put the conditioner on and put my hair in a bun and let the conditioner sit while I body wash the rest of my body in warm water.  Than I just finish with the cold rise of the conditioner.  Its a few more steps than a normal shower but I'ts worth it to me as I love my hair and by the way I'm 50 years old.

This one, not much at all.  I liked the idea that it was sulfate-free, to protect my color.  I thought it would be gentle and moisturizing.  (I have been using Nexxus Emergencee Shampoo, and that is very moisturizing.)  This just strips my hair.  Even as I am rinsing it out, it immediately is a tangled mess, and feels stripped.  I have a hard time getting my fingers through it as I try and rinse it out.  I really can't comment as to the color preservation abilities of it, as I think I have only used it four times.  I wish I hadn't bought such a big bottle.  It's a lot to just throw away.  I just figured I would like it.  I hate it.  I have to put a lot of conditioner in, about double what I normally use after shampooing, so I can comb through my hair.  I feel like I undo any improvement I have done with the Emergencee shampoo and conditioner.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I guess if I had to find one good thing to say about it, it would be that it doesn't make my scalp itch.  That's it.  That's the best I can do."

This amazingly inexpensive conditioner has been the only conditioner that I have consistently good results from, and I've tried salon brands.  It's moisturizing without feeling oily or heavy.  The scent is good, though I find it barely noticeable after showering--which isn't a bad thing, especially when my husband uses it and doesn't want a floral shampoo mixing with his cologne.  My only complaint is the bottle design: I think the different shapes for conditioner and shampoo aren't enough to differentiate.

I've used tons of different conditioners on my thick, curly, long hair, and this might be the worst I've ever used.  It leaves a really strange residue and makes it almost impossible to comb out.  I have used all natural hair products before and I know that there's an adjustment period but I've given it 3 weeks and there is zero improvement in it's effectiveness, in fact, it may have gotten worse as time as went by."

And my hair is so soft, I've tried many hair products for dry scalp and dandruff, and so far this has been the only one worked for me..I love the ingredients, the smell is wonderful, it lathers nicely and the conditioner leaves my hair very easy to comb through and soft and shiny...so glad I found this product...it's deserving of more than five stars in my opinion."

I had NO IDEA there was even wax in shampoo, let alone a brand as good as Redken All Soft. Sure enough, it has dimethyicone! Also, the bottom layers of my hair are also pretty soft and healthy, but the top layer is like a brillo pad - frizzy and dry. She recommended that I use shampoo infused with Keratin and suggested Keratherapy (which she carries in her salon). I used it tonight and now I am a believer!!

I say almost because there's just a tad more shine and a tad more softness to my hair when freshly washed. The smell isn't perfumy or powdery, it's just a clean scent. My hair lasted for about 5ish hours before I needed to pull it back, but even in pulling it back it looked better than it would have without the product.

I bought this straight from Amazon and everything is as expected and a fraction of the price. I definitely love the lather in this shampoo and the scent is a nice, non-synthetic smelling rosemary scent. It smells more like essential oils which tend to have a more powerful scent, but it still isn't overly powerful to me (and everything gives me headaches if it is). I have found the conditioner isn't as moisturizing as it claims to be if your hair is processed or overly processed from lightening or dyeing. I definitely recommend using this in lieu of a deep conditioning treatment. I have chemically lightened hair to platinum and use oVertone coloring conditioner (a semi-permanent fantasy dye) with this and it works great. It doesn't make my fantasy colors bleed too much and keeps them vibrant with the UV protection. Overall a good buy for the price."

I decided about 8 months ago to stop coloring my hair which was brunette with over-all warm highlights. My natural color came in an odd mix of silver, dark grey and very dull, dark brown. So I searched for a shampoo that would subdue the remaining warm brown/blond and blend demarcation line. From online research alone, I decided on Sachajuan Silver. I had never heard of the brand prior to this purchase. I have discovered it not only subdues warm/yellow tints, both in old AND new growth, but is also a great shampoo. A VERY small amount makes huge lather with pleasant, mild scent. I wash my hair almost daily and, thus far, the product has been moisturizing while also adding a little extra volume to my very soft, fine hair. However, I do not use this exclusively, alternating with another old-favorite regular. Going natural process is a pain, but this product has certainly helped me along....although I found a little extra neatness effort was required (for me anyway) when using a dark blue shampoo. Cost is moderately high, but similar to many others with far less to offer. I highly recommend."

I've tried every, EVERY violet shampoo that is currently on the market over the last three years. Nothing compares to Sacha Juan. If you have well water and have brassy tones, you need this shampoo. If you have faded hilights or bleach, this is your savior. It also works wonders for Grey/silver hair that's turned yellow. You shouldn't use this every time you shampoo, but I do because it makes my fine hair so bouncy and full. What I do is, the first shampoo, I use a conditioning/hydrating shampoo because this will dry your hair out if not careful. The second shampoo, I use the Sacha Juan and leave it on my head for about five minutes while I shave/exfoliate. Then rinse it out, apply conditioner. Since my hair is bleached, I use a hair mask once a week and use a leave-in conditioner every time I get out of the shower so it doesn't dry out. Also, this bottle will last you at least three months, so don't worry about the cost."

It‚Äôs not a moisturizing shampoo, it actually dries your hair out.  No scent really.  It is a real deep shade of violet.  It does it‚Äôs job and a little goes a long way, but it is really rough on your hair.  Use a good conditioner after using this shampoo.  Do not use this shampoo every day unless you want your hair to break off.  I have to use a hair oil to put back the life to my hair.  It‚Äôs probably the strongest shampoo I have ever used."

Usually I have to settle for some form of yellow in it, which bums me out.  Although there are many anti-brassiness products on the market for blonde or highlighted hair, none so far have come close to knocking brassiness on its a**.  This shampoo is so full of color, that 1. it does do the job WELL, 2. i'm afraid of using the matching conditioner because i wasn't aiming for lavender hair, and 3. I'm just realizing that it's a little expensive so maybe I should use a regular shampoo and not this one every single day.  I can use whatever other brand shampoo some days but use this when the hair is starting to look like it needs a tone boost.  4.  Its arguably stronger than a toner, which is usually bad for your hair when it contains ammonia or peroxide. When EVER possible, with bleached hair you should use deposit only toners (which is where manic panic's virgin snow comes in).  But sometimes toners just make it worse not to mention damage the hair.  The only sad part is if you use a lot of products and need a deep cleaning shampoo, dont waste this on that purpose."

I wanted to try this because it specifically said it was for dark hair and my hairdresser recommended it. I will say this does go on white like other dry shampoos, BUT once you massage it into your scalp or let it sit and absorb all the oils, it disappears. I didn‚Äôt find that it left my hair dull either. Dry shampoo can be tricky for some people. I would recommend using it before bed that way it has time to absorb oil over night and you‚Äôll wake up and not have to massage it in or brush it out. Also if you look at some of the pictures people are posting they are literally spraying half the bottle on their head...like of course it‚Äôs going to be a thick white powdery mess - You don‚Äôt need that much! Spray it where your hair usually looks oily (along your part, maybe an inch or two out from your roots, along your hairline/face).  Again you don‚Äôt need a lot!  I like this brand because it smells good, takes care of the oil, and doesn‚Äôt leave my hair dull like other dry shampoos. I would highly recommend!"

Your hair produces natural oils and if you strip them every day by washing it, it will only start to produce more and cause more and more problems. There will be an adjustment time for sure, but you will thank me after a month! I only use this product about 2 times a week and it is good for me, and will last a really long time."

Unfortunately, it did not work for me. I have a semi-oily scalp, meaning after two days of not washing my hair, it gets oily. But since using this product, it has increased the oil in my hair. Now, after a night, my hair is oily the next day and I have to wash it. I used dry shampoo before every once in a while, but if I miss a wash, I have to use it daily. I gave it four stars because my sisters mother in law's hair was so processed and damaged and after a few months of using this product, her hair was beautiful. Which is what encouraged me to go out and buy it. I think its a good product but keep in mind, if you have an oily scalp, it might make it more oily."

Being obsessive about hair, I read all the reviews I could on cheaper substitutes. I tried about 30 brands and my hair was taking a beating. I was about to give up on having beautiful hair again because my hair was starting to look so dry and brittle with split ends that I couldn't stop breaking off throughout the day. So many sulfate free and/or ""Organic"" and ""Natural"" products that I had high hopes for, failed me. I was planning on going to Target to try the next cheapie, but I decided to look at the Amazon reviews on conditioner one last time. I found this duo with awesome reviews. It was a little more expensive than what I had been trying, but it came in a huge bottle, so what the heck. Bought it. Love it... Smell reminds me of hair salon conditioner (which I love).. Hair feels clean, but not greasy at all. I can go longer than a day without washing my hair without looking like I put wax in it. It also helped tame the frizz. My hair just feels and looks healthier. I am hooked. Totally worth this price and still way more inexpensive than Pureology, and a worthy replacement."

Yeah the price is up there, but as a guy I use so little of this stuff that it might literally last a year or more. I even used this stuff one night and then used my old shampoo the next few nights and my hair was still soft. Does that sound weird for a guy to say his hair was soft? Actually I don't care. It is soft and I like it. Definitely worth a try especially because you use so little (seriously, I have more snot come out of my nose in the morning then the needed amount of shampoo for my hair)."

The smell is different (similar but not quite as good in my opinion), the consistency is a lot less thick, and the color is off as well (more see-through than creamy).

It doesn't have that Dove smell to it and it doesn't have that creamy silky texture that Dove has either. I use a lot of Dove and in my opinion this just isn't it.

        ",Verified Purchase,,"I love this product. My husband somehow goes through a bottle of body wash per week, but with this large size bottle, I don't have to change it out as frequently.  For one, the bottle holds a lot of product, and two, the pump dispenses a normal amount of body wash, minimizing the amount my husband uses.  The scent is a fairly neutral 'clean' scent, so we are both fine using this product. This means one less bottle of product taking up real estate in the shower. As for moisturizing, I still need to follow up with lotion, but my skin definitely feels softer right out of the shower."

In fact, a bit perfumy if you ask me. It reminds me of grandma's perfume. It's nothing like actual lavender or even a lavender scent blend. And I don't detect any Chamomile at all. I can't speak as to the Ylang-Ylang, as I've never smelled it before. Although I did Google Ylang-Ylang. Apparently -that- is used in perfumes. Perhaps that's why this body wash smells a lot like Grandma's perfume?"

B07J5JNT1P,2022,1,20,5,Worth the $ but inconsistency in bottling process,4.0 out of 5 stars,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2020",Amanda,,Verified Purchase,,I‚Äôve recently received my first shipment of subscribe and save items from amazon. My household goes through a lot of body wash and was looking for something cost effective. I found these at a decent price for the quantity of product. The kids were sealed and unbroken when I opened the box. According to some other reviews that has been a problem but it seems they have mastered packaging them. The smell is fairly strong and pretty floral. However I feel this will dissipate when showering. My only issue is he inconsistently filled as you can see in the picture 2 of them have less product than the others. I even let them sit out for an hour and settle before taking the picture.

B07J5JNT1P,2022,1,20,7,Good scent that fills the bathroom,5.0 out of 5 stars,6 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020",Roy R.,,Verified Purchase,,"The scent is bold fragrance that fills the space when lathering up and lingers after use, not really on the person but in the shower area. The smell is almost entirely floral, so if you like that its perfect, if your not a fan of flowery smells then this is a skip. I'm a man and it is definitely a noticeable girly smell but I like that its bold and fills the bathroom. So I would buy it again if I dont find another fragrance I prefer."
B07J5JNT1P,2022,1,20,8,Excellent Value No Allergic Reaction and my itch dry skin began to stop itching heal up asap,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2021",Kindle Customer,,Verified Purchase,,I really liked this. It has a very soap clean smell with a light fruit after scent. I had no reaction to it. I had some reservations because it does have some yellow dye in it but my allergies are very bad to red. I have lots of reactions to many products and fragrances and this is fragrance added free with just a light natural scent that is very clean and pleasant to it. It has been a long time since I smelled a body wash that smelled like it would clean very well so I was pleased it moisturized well also.
B07SX2P9G7,2022,1,20,1,The most cost-effective body wash for sensitive skin :),5.0 out of 5 stars,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020",Star,,Verified Purchase,,"I have sensitive skin and if I use other soap or body wash, I either feel dirty or dried out. I'm sure that there are expensive body washes that optimizes your skin condition, but those typically cost a lot more than I'd be willing to pay for. So, I hunt for cheaper products that gets the job done. I've used dove, olay, bath and body works product, body shop products, myers, etc... I really enjoyed using products from body shop because they smell amazing, but they are also not very cost-effective (small containers with a substantial price tag for a body wash). I normally don't use Dial products because they dry my skin out, but this particular body wash has just the right mix. It moisturizes, cleans, smells amazing and it is sold at a reasonable and affordable price point. If you have eczema or other skin condition, I can't say that this will be a ""cure"" for that; however, I noticed that my skin did not flare as often. I got a three month subscription because these are hard to find in stores. I used to get these from walmart, but they go out of stock from time to time and there is not much price difference even if you get it through amazon."
