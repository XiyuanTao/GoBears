My hair stylist recommended a VERY expensive hair care line, which admittedly worked but I did not want to spend so extravagantly on shampoo and conditioner. Then this Dove line came out, so I tried it. Thank God! Not only do I no longer have the breakage problem, my hair feels stronger and improved for a lot less money than the expensive salon line. The breakage problem is gone! This shampoo and conditioner do not weigh down my fine hair and I‚Äôve used them faithfully for several months now.

It's arguably considered one of the better silicones, but I didn't want any. I should've looked at the ingredients more closely before buying instead of falling for the ad. As for the product itself, the shampoo didn't work for me. My hair felt drier, built up, and more brittle than my previous shampoo. I won't knock it for that because I know not all products work for everyone. I didn't use their conditioner because of the silicone listed, and used my previous conditioner with their shampoo for this time."

Lather, let it it sit, and then convince yourself to rinse away the tingle that comes from this shampoo. The tea tree oil will help keep dandruff at bay, and the peppermint makes your hair so soft! Used by beauticians everywhere. Once you experience the minty tingle, you won't want anything else to touch your tresses, so it's a good thing they have a conditioner that complements, down to being the same composition in a moisturizing, soothing formula. Fall in love, as I did."

I no longer have chronic itchy scalp thanks to this shampoo and conditioner.  However, it's a mediocre conditioner on the hair itself.  I have thick coarse hair and this conditioner does nothing to de-tangle or smooth out my hair strands.  I haven't had this problem with other conditioners before.  With this conditioner, I have to use a hair serum on my hair afterwards in order to de-tangle my hair so I can comb through it.  I'll stick with the shampoo, but I'm going to switch to a different conditioner."

It lathers and rinses very well, it smells great, and it WORKS!!  So far I have noticed no itching since we switched.  I am very pleased with it!

I have very bushy, wild, hair that I‚Äôve always put up in a bun because straightening takes too long and doesn‚Äôt even last a whole day. The first time I used it I left my hair down and let it air dry. When my boyfriend came home from work he asked me where I was going...I was confused because I hadn‚Äôt planned to go anywhere. He said my hair looked very nice and he knew me well enough to know I don‚Äôt ever style my hair so I must have been getting ready to go out. I went to look in the mirror and I was shocked. My normally unorganized curly frizz actually had formed into perfect ringlet curls all over. And as any curly haired girl will know, with the lesser brands you have to use so much to get the tangles out, but if you cross the fine line to too much you end up with a greasy look. With this stuff I only use 1 pump of shampoo, and 1 1/2 pumps of condition. It lasts me so much longer than the cheaper brands, so even though it costs more up front, you don‚Äôt have to buy as often which means over time you don‚Äôt really pay much more than for the cheap stuff. It also smells great all day."

After I used the shampoo, I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed until I felt like my hair was reasonably clean, but it was still so greasy that I didn't even use the conditioner. My hair is wavy caucasian hair and although I like hair care to be somewhat moisturizing and not stripping, this was FAR too greasy and heavy. I matched my hair type on their website to their suggestions and ordered this for me to use and for my teen daughter with loose curly hair. I wish I could give it 5 starts, because the ingredients are much safer than most other shampoos, but I can't because it is NOT good for typical caucasian hair in my opinion. People with dry curls may like it and it likely is great for those that want a REALLY HEAVY THICK moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it was so thick that my daughter's hair looked about 3 shades darker until she rewashed it with Acure (which we've used for the past few years)."

This curl shampoo enhances, like a curl cream or other styling product, and makes my wavy hair curly almost immediately- I wonder if it's the neem oil or hibiscus but the effect is darn visible! I love it because the look I get right after I shampoo and air dry my hair is natural, healthy, curly, and more tamed than other SLS products have gotten me. On a side note, my mom has been using Shea Moisture hair color and she swears by it too! Shea moisture seems like a reputed and effective brand because it's delivering results.

I feel like the people that gave this a bad review did not give it a chance to actually work so I stuck through and kept using it after one week of using the shampoo and conditioner I stopped losing gobs of hair in the shower Before this I even quit washing my hair because I was tired of losing so much hair I really feel that it was the store-bought shampoos that I was using they have shelflife chemicals in them they‚Äôre just not good. this shampoo I can honestly say has improved the amount of hair that I was losing in between washes I can also say I am seeing a little bit of hair growth I‚Äôm gonna give it like I said three more months to see where were at. Ps. My bf even noticed I wasn‚Äôt leaving behind so much hair in the bath anymore and thanked me for finally cleaning it up I laughed told him it‚Äôs not me it‚Äôs the shampoo but your welcome.ü§™üòé

THAT'S what we're here for. Many a year I have searched for a shampoo that I felt cleaned my hair but also moisturized it. Shampoos I've tried before have stripped my hair of natural moisture and made it harder to keep it moisturized since I'm trying to force what little moisture was there back in and get even more. This shampoo, man of man, I could feel my hair reacting too it as I put it in. One use and I was like, well I've found my new shampoo for life. Due to the pandemic, shampoo and conditioner is hard to come by in store so I tried Amazon and I chose this specific conditioner because I already knew I liked Hello Hydration by them, and they were both coconut so I figured they'd be similar. They are in that both do my hair RIGHT.

It is very strong so my advice to you is ""less is more"". What I mean is if you are using it for the first time and don't know how long to keep it on, choose the lesser time. For example, I left the product on for 3 minutes the first time. It definitely toned down the brassiness in my hair, but it wasn't quite the silver color I was trying to achieve. I waited a few days and a couple of shampoos later, I tried again and left it on for about 6 minutes and there was quite a bit of silver tone to it. So, it really depends on what color you are trying to achieve. I am trying to stay current with the silvery blonde look that seems to be in now. I am very happy with this product and I hope more people in the US find out about it. NOTE: The picture where I‚Äôm wearing the black sweatshirt is the before shot.

Not good.",2.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2020",Brittany,,Verified Purchase,,"I used this for 2 weeks. 5 times all together and the last time I used it I started to notice my scalp was hurting, like from clogged or irritated pores or something. I have experienced this type of reaction with some shampoos in the past. I never knew what caused it. I love my Andalou citrus shampoo that I have been using this past year, with the conditioner but I was just wanting a bit more volume at my roots. I still have not found a leave in to give my roots volume, so I thought shampoo might do the trick. There were a ton of positive reviews and this is a fair price. So, I figured why not try it? My scalp hurts so bad now!!! I have KP (Keratosis pilaris) which is a skin condition that is basically small, red bumps of clogged hair follicles. There is no treatment and it is not contagious, it‚Äôs just genetics. So maybe an ingredient that this contains caused a flare up. Possibly the peppermint? It is a known skin irritator. It also made my hair dry and frizzy. REALLY frizzy. It didn‚Äôt make my scalp greasy, though and that‚Äôs why I kept using it. It didn‚Äôt really add any volume and combating the frizz I eas was tough. I also started to notice my hair was thinning a bit, so I discontinued use and went back to my original shampoo. My hair is starting to recover but my scalp is still in bad condition. Its still painful and irritated. Hurts to touch. It‚Äôs only been around 4 days since I stopped using it, though. This also contains sodium hydroxide and that could have have caused a problem, too. Honestly, I would not recommend this. I would recommend the Andalou citrus shampoo and the Christina Moss shampoo for salon quality hair. I am going to try the Andalou volumizing shampoo next since I seem to have better luck with their brand! 2 stars for the fair price and almost all good ingredients."

After I used the shampoo, I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed until I felt like my hair was reasonably clean, but it was still so greasy that I didn't even use the conditioner. My hair is wavy caucasian hair and although I like hair care to be somewhat moisturizing and not stripping, this was FAR too greasy and heavy. I matched my hair type on their website to their suggestions and ordered this for me to use and for my teen daughter with loose curly hair. I wish I could give it 5 starts, because the ingredients are much safer than most other shampoos, but I can't because it is NOT good for typical caucasian hair in my opinion. People with dry curls may like it and it likely is great for those that want a REALLY HEAVY THICK moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it was so thick that my daughter's hair looked about 3 shades darker until she rewashed it with Acure (which we've used for the past few years)."

This curl shampoo enhances, like a curl cream or other styling product, and makes my wavy hair curly almost immediately- I wonder if it's the neem oil or hibiscus but the effect is darn visible! I love it because the look I get right after I shampoo and air dry my hair is natural, healthy, curly, and more tamed than other SLS products have gotten me. On a side note, my mom has been using Shea Moisture hair color and she swears by it too! Shea moisture seems like a reputed and effective brand because it's delivering results.

My hair was brittle and seemed always dry no matter what products I would put on it. I thought that I would have had to cut my hair and start completely over. However, when my products arrived, I could not wait to give them a try. I love the smells. Very nice and not powerful. I washed my hair twice with the Nexxus Shampoo, first time just the scalp, and the second wash, the hair itself. The way that my hair reacted to this shampoo was breathtaking! My curls appeared and believe it or not, I was able to pull a comb through my thick, natural, 4C  hair!! I have never, ever been able to do this before while washing. Barely any hair was coming out in my comb! I had not even used the conditioner yet. I just had to stop and look in the mirror and talk to myself saying, ""Omg, I cannot believe this""! I have never, ever experienced a shampoo doing my hair like this before. After I completely rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I moved on to the Nexxus Conditioner. Even more amazing. It stated to leave on the hair for 3 min, but I sat under a hooded dryer for about 10min with the conditioner on my hair, under a plastic cap. Once my time was up, I rinsed away all of the conditioner. My hair was so manageable!! I was able to comb and section it to do my bantu knots and allow my hair to dry overnight. After washing my hair, it only took me about 30 min to get it  all done to dry. I have never been able to complete this process this quickly before! I am highly satisfied with these products! Even though they are  expensive products, I'm hooked and will be purchasing again. I told my mom about my experience and am ready to try it on her hair also, to see if she gets the same experience and satisfaction that I got. Thank you Nexxus for such wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them. Definitely a must try on the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner for Severely damaged hair. This is my first time ever writing a review on a product. That's how pleased I was with these products!!"

This shampoo/conditioner makes my hair shiny and so soft. I've used more shampoos than I can count and this is the first to give me noticeable results after just one use. I will say that if you are sensitive to perfume smells, this may be too strong for you. I enjoy the sent and the fact that my hair holds that sent beyond 24 hours. Even after using a different shampoo for a day, the smell of this one still comes through. Also, if you are prone to greasy hair, this may make it worse. I do not have this issue typically, but at the end of the day after using this, there is a subtle heaviness to my roots. All of this being said, this is my new favorite beauty product."

Tiny amounts on my shoulder or the back of my neck, on my pillow when I woke up in the morning, it was something I was very selfconscious about and embarrassed.  Being a guy though, I rarely go to the doctor, and really how many guys would go to the doctor to talk about such a small problem.  So I tried everything, every shampoo in the supermarket isle, I changed hair gels 20 times, stopped using hair gels all together."

I've had very bad dandruff for over four years, as a result of dry skin than came on suddenly.  I find that almost any shampoo (even non-dandruff shampoos) will prevent dandruff for a few days.  Then it comes back as bad as ever.  Nizoral is the most effective shampoo I've tried.  It isn't a cure for me, as it has seemingly been for others here.  It started out great, nearly eliminating the flaking and itching.  After a couple of weeks of use about every 3 days, it became less effective, with flaking and itching starting in the afternoon -- but the flakes were smaller and the itching less intense than with other shampoos.  After eight months, it is still good, but I get flakes and itching every day.  It's expensive, but it offers some relief.  On the non-Nizoral days I usually use the Ginger shampoo from The Body Shop."

It lathers very well and smells nice. I did not use any conditioner after, and my hair is soft and tangle free. I have natural grey hair that is rather dry at the ends, and this helps tame the ends.  In addition, I flat iron my hair. With Olaplex, my hair is already more smooth after the treatment and shampoo, so when I flat iron, I don't need to spend as much time with the iron! Even two days after treatment and styling, my hair is still soft and flowing. Together with Olaplex No. 3, I am already seeing the difference in my hair, and I am happy. Grey hair is not easy to tame, so I have tried many products. Olaplex is the solution I have been waiting for."

        ",Verified Purchase,,"I have been using this solid shampoo for about a month now. The actual formulation is really great. It is not drying or moisturizing and does not weigh hair down. It does exactly what it says it will do: volumize. The scent is extremely mild (and I typically avoid products with any fragrance) and pleasant. My only real complaint, and it's mild, is the bar itself: I hate the shape. Sure, it's pretty and it's fine to hold, but I don't think the shape is ideal to rub on your head. I MUCH prefer the usual round shape, which all other shampoo bars use. I am guessing someone designed this convoluted shape to differentiate it from all the others, but in my opinion this bizarrely shaped (although aesthetically pleasing) bar isn't an improvement.

However, once I have enough on there, I get a nice, thorough clean out of it. I've been using it about a month now and I've only used half of a bar.

I have very bushy, wild, hair that I‚Äôve always put up in a bun because straightening takes too long and doesn‚Äôt even last a whole day. The first time I used it I left my hair down and let it air dry. When my boyfriend came home from work he asked me where I was going...I was confused because I hadn‚Äôt planned to go anywhere. He said my hair looked very nice and he knew me well enough to know I don‚Äôt ever style my hair so I must have been getting ready to go out. I went to look in the mirror and I was shocked. My normally unorganized curly frizz actually had formed into perfect ringlet curls all over. And as any curly haired girl will know, with the lesser brands you have to use so much to get the tangles out, but if you cross the fine line to too much you end up with a greasy look. With this stuff I only use 1 pump of shampoo, and 1 1/2 pumps of condition. It lasts me so much longer than the cheaper brands, so even though it costs more up front, you don‚Äôt have to buy as often which means over time you don‚Äôt really pay much more than for the cheap stuff. It also smells great all day."

I got pregnant a little over a year ago, and since then my hair has never been the same. All the products I had used for years to keep it healthy, soft and long stopped working. On top of all that I decided to start dying it myself (blonde) and anyone who has attempted to do blonde themselves knows... I finally got it the color I wanted, but I've noticed my already thinning hair was falling out more and more. I've tried too many moisture renewal, damage repair, thickening, anti hair loss products to count over thse last year with absolutely no results. So finding this product and reading reviews I was excited to try this to slow down my hair loss and give me some volume. Last night was my first use and I am beyond impressed. Not only did my hair feel a tad bit fuller in just one wash, but it is extremely soft and moisturized for the first time in over a year! I was not expecting it to make my hair feel so amazing, in fact I was prepared for brittle tangly hair like most thickening shampoos and conditioners give me. The only thing I was a little disappointed with was the shampoo doesnt get super sudsy while washing, but that's a personal preference of mine. And I may have not used enough, so I'm going to try using a little more tonight! Since I have only used it once I will update this review in a few weeks. But even if it doesnt help with my hair loss, I plan to continue using this shampoo and conditioner just because it makes my hair feel amazing and HEALTHY!!!"

Recently, I ordered Redken Shampoo from Amazon (labeled exactly the same as the product I have been getting from the cosmotologist).  The Amazon Redken Shampoo, however, has a very different consistency, and after using it my hair was frizzy and dry, and my scalp was itchy.  I spoke with my cosmotologist, and she said only licensed cosmotologists are allowed to purchase this Redken Shampoo.  She said it is not available to the general public, even at a Sally Beauty Supply.  I do not recommend this Amazon Redken Shampoo, as my hair was frizzy and dry, and my scalp was itchy after using it, not at all like the REAL Redken Shampoo supplied by my cosmotologist."

I bought a salon quality clarifying shampoo and it cleared it up after just one use. However, just to be certain, I used this shampoo again the next night.

I had fried my hair with years of bleaching it and decided to dye it my natural color and let it grow. My hair had been looking so harsh and dried out, but once I started using this, from the very first use it became much more soft and manageable. I will admit, The first week my scalp did get quite a few pimples along the hair line, but I have very sensitive skin so any changes to my routine usually causes breakouts. So maybe those that are complaining have not given their skin enough time to adapt to the change. I think the scent is perfect, and smells just like the salon quality stuff. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and use Biosilk before drying my hair and my hair has never been softer."

The scent is faint and disappears a few minutes after application (I was looking for parfum free but it‚Äôs hard to find). The oil is very light and does not weigh your hair down.

I had resorted to using a stripping shampoo once per week, but my hair would be totally dried out afterward, and the buildup would begin immediately the next day. This shampoo left my hair soft yet product-free after just one wash. My hair is noticeably softer, and any trace of greasiness is gone. It doesn't strip everything off to the point that my hair feels totally de-oiled and dried out, like it would after using the stripping shampoo. The only potential drawback for some people might be that it doesn't have a strong pleasant scent that I have noticed with other Nexxus products. Rather, it has a very light scent that reminds me of incense. I use a conditioner from Nexxus that smells of coconuts after using this product, but that's just personal preference. I would absolutely recommend this product if you want softer hair that won't retain product buildup!"

But, smells good and as a licensed cosmetologist, I xan say that the tingly feeling helped loosen my scalp to massage my scalp during shampoo. (Massage keeps blood flow to decrease un-natural hairloss.) I also used the matching conditioner. Which also gave a very good tingly feel. Now for those who hair is naturally dry, do not run from this product. Purchase a good conditioning hair mask and apply before the matching contioner or after which ever you perfer. I do before to hydrate easier. When your out add some hydrating leave in creams. One of my favorite is butter cream by ""As I Am"". For Ethnic hair types I would not use this product everyday, due to the drying effect it gives. I would love to see the makes create a product that moisturizes as well for ethnic hair or even create a hair mask for dry hair. Even for Caucasian hair I would use a light pea size oil on palm when done, rub vigorously on palm and add to whole hair to keep the fly aways from looking like a over permed 80's curls. Overall I gave a 4 stars due to the overdrying effect it gives (that is to any hair type) but for Caucasian the conditioner should give a 5 syar effect. Would I purchase again? So far yes. I always do a re-review after a couple months. I feel this product is good for a youtube channel review, so I may do it there as well. Review would be if this product actually works? So far honest review after one wash I would purchase again."

I used to use Nizoral shampoo that my dermatologist recommended, as I also have scalp oiliness and dandruff associated with my hair loss. But I found Nizoral to be too drying and I could only use it once or twice a week or it made me itch more. So I really wanted to find something that thoroughly cleaned all the scalp debris, didn‚Äôt bother my sensitive scalp, and could be used everyday. I‚Äôve been using the Nioxin system at the recommendation of a hair stylist for almost a year now, and I don‚Äôt plan on ever using anything else. It has kept my scalp in really great condition and is gentle enough to use daily. I can‚Äôt say it helps with hair loss necessarily, but I have seen more baby hairs growing recently so maybe it does a little. Mainly it will help with the overall appearance of your hair loss. It makes hair look super clean and thus thicker when you‚Äôre using it. Sometimes it can be hard to make thinner hair look clean as it always wants to look stringy. So it‚Äôs definitely helped with that. I would recommend giving it a shot if you have dandruff or hair loss issues."

It produces more sores and causes you to scratch your head like a crackhead. I wish I could give this product a .5 cause this definitely isn't for black hair or anyone's hair if we are being honest.

I have yet to find a shampoo that leaves my hair not feeling dry afterwards, but it is better than others I have tried in the past and I do like it. It kind of smells like a cross between vanilla extract and licorice with a hint of mint or something, good though. It's foamy and a little goes a long way. This bottle will last me forever as I only use it once and awhile. Overall, I prefer using a cowash (as I am coconut cowash-this stuff is awesome!) because of how dry my hair tends to be.

The pic on the right has my red/purple mix hair 1 month later and the left pic is 3 months later turns into a nice light brown.  The key to keeping the red longer is wash your hair in cold water with good product and I only wash every 3 days.  I also believe it's because the red was mix with purple gives it a nice look as it's faded till your next appoint to the beauty parlor.  I stick my head in cooler water and wash my hair and than I put the conditioner on and put my hair in a bun and let the conditioner sit while I body wash the rest of my body in warm water.  Than I just finish with the cold rise of the conditioner.  Its a few more steps than a normal shower but I'ts worth it to me as I love my hair and by the way I'm 50 years old.

(I have been using Nexxus Emergencee Shampoo, and that is very moisturizing.)  This just strips my hair.  Even as I am rinsing it out, it immediately is a tangled mess, and feels stripped.  I have a hard time getting my fingers through it as I try and rinse it out.  I really can't comment as to the color preservation abilities of it, as I think I have only used it four times.  I wish I hadn't bought such a big bottle.  It's a lot to just throw away.  I just figured I would like it.  I hate it.  I have to put a lot of conditioner in, about double what I normally use after shampooing, so I can comb through my hair.  I feel like I undo any improvement I have done with the Emergencee shampoo and conditioner.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I guess if I had to find one good thing to say about it, it would be that it doesn't make my scalp itch.  That's it.  That's the best I can do."

I find my hair and skin take to it better and doesn't at all trigger any acne in fact since I have so many skin allergies to face wash products and soap products from other companies I have resorted to washing my face with the extra strength version and my face has been taking well to the extra strength version, with no acne, no rashes and no enlarging of pores from it. Whether its correct or not I finally found something that I can also wash my face with that won't cause me any emergence of skin rashes nor does it seem to cause any acne and I have been using it for months. This version that is not extra strength I also use at times on my face too and I do find that occassionally it might cause a pimple or two and very occasionally some slight redness that usually clears up quickly. Now for the part that most people are interested in I have brunette and fine not thin/ thinning hair and both regular and extra strength versions even without the conditioner leave your hair extra silky smooth more manageable for my hair texture and fine hair type and bring out my natural colors and tones that are sometimes opaqued by cheap or heavily moisturizing shampoos. Both shampoos do give your hair aome good balanced volume but for all that I stated the shine the extra tones and more clearer lights/ highlights on my hair volume, and maintaining the health and luster I still recommend the extra strength version. Both are good but the extra strengrh version in my case just goes the extra mile and takes the cake in my opinion and experience. I still give this product 5/ 5 stars. I still reccomend to add the extra strength argan oil conditioner it'll do even more wonders for you and leave an even more beautiful luster that brings out/ highlights your natural highlights. üòâ"

The shampoo does come in a smaller bottle. It has a flip cap. I used only a small amount which was plenty. It lathers up great and smells terrific. A perfume smell but it's not overwhelming or strong. I followed with the conditioner. When I dried my hair I was in awe. I have straight, flat, thin hair. This shampoo, in just the first time I used it, did wonders for my hair. It was shiny, had life to it, was soft. But even though it was soft, I was able to curl it with a curling iron and it stayed. The scent stayed with me most of the day. I think the scent smells expensive too!!!! I think the bottle will last quite awhile since you only have to use a small amount. I do have short hair. I  know this is a lot of money to spend on shampoo, but the way my hair has changed for the better, it was easy to fix, saved me time and smells so good, to me it's worth it. I will definitely buy this shampoo again. No question about it. I'd rather spend money on a product I know is great than keep trying different cheaper products and find they don't work.

I bought this shampoo and used it for two weeks, and by the end of the two weeks, my hair was brittle, falling out, and my scalp was very red. I have never had such bad results from a shampoo before. I find it hard to believe the ingredients listed are the true ingredients, because I've never reacted like this to shampoo, and I've tried many different shampoos (health store brands and normal brands). After reacting so poorly, I used fakespot and saw that the service detected lots of unreliable reviews for this product and a lot of the brand's products. Just beware purchasing this, and be wary of the overly positive reviews. The only nice thing about the shampoo is that is does smell nice, but that's about it."

I really like the scent and this stuff actually makes my hair feel softer than some much more expensive shampoos and conditioners I have used.  I think the key is, don't overuse it - meaning, you are only supposed to wash your hair 2 or 3 times per WEEK. Your hair produces natural oils and if you strip them every day by washing it, it will only start to produce more and cause more and more problems. There will be an adjustment time for sure, but you will thank me after a month! I only use this product about 2 times a week and it is good for me, and will last a really long time."

The shampoo has a great scent that is gender neutral. My wife has been coming into my shower and using this shampoo, and she loves it too. After using the shampoo for over a week, I could tell my hair felt thicker and had more volume. The shampoo was gentle on my scalp and did not dry it out like similar products that I have used. To be honest I am also using this alongside their hair pills, which is how I came to find out about this shampoo. If you have thinning hair and need a shampoo that smells great, gentle on your scalp and actually works - this is the product for you. The only thing they need to improve is to have this in a bigger bottle instead of two small bottles, which is a waste of plastic and creates extra waste for the environment."

Poon,,Verified Purchase,,"I'm going to date myself here for a second, but this is pretty much the 'scalp' version of the 1990s 'Hair stripper' (used to remove waxy build up on hair). And like it's 90s counter-part, you really shouldn't use this more than once a month. This really does clean out your scalp, BUT it will EXTREMELY dry out your hair and start to make it brittle (I recommend using a leave in conditioner a day later as damage control). The 'recommended' scrub brush they tell you buy isn't necessary; but after using my finger nails and seeing the build up come off and realizing how absolutely disgusting it was, I was sold on buying that rubber hair brush."

I have tried extensive preening, scalp massaging, scalp massagers, double-shampooing, using less shampoo/condition/product in general, using MORE shampoo/conditioner/product in general... and frankly the situation still sucks.

Must say it works better with the matching conditioner. I've recently been using a different conditioner and the results are not as good."

Compares VERY favorably against far more costly products I have tried. The fragrance is minimal, but pleasant. Hair is soft and has a fuller appearance. A little goes a long way if you have shorter hair.  My only observation is that, while the bottles are uniquely shaped and appealing, they are VERY impractical for use on the shower. They can be quite slippery and difficult to handle. They also will not stand in an inverted position. If you are anything like me, I like to turn my bottles upside down when it‚Äôs getting to the end to get as much out as possible before replacing. Still, not enough for me to ding the product itself, which is effective. I circumvent the packaging issue by transferring the shampoo and conditioner to pump bottles."

My hair stylist recommended that I use a blue shampoo that would stop my hair from going orangy (brassy), and I needed to find one that was curly-girl friendly. This fit the bill, along with having a conditioner to go along with it. I gave it a go since the salon quality products I had been using were not blue or purple per se. Both the shampoo and conditioner are wonderful and my hair has stayed true to color over the seven weeks I've used it (once or twice a week). Very happy for this - it smells great, leaves my hair without tons of tangles, soft, looking good."

Super clean yet also super moisturized. I still use conditioner after this, but my hair would be fine even if I didn't. The fragrance is strong and took some initial getting used to after switching back from natural shampoos, but I stopped noticing it by day 3.

Also a note to the shipper, the shampoo did leak inside the bag that covered the bottle.  My suggestion is to have a tight sticky foil or cardboard paper glued to the bottle opening so it does not leak.  My bottle did leak but not to bad of a mess.  I had to clean it up, my counter and the outside of the bottle.  It didn't lose to much shampoo but that can be prevented with a sealed tab on the bottle opening.  I am not sending back the shampoo.  It may have lost maybe 2 tsp. fulls of shampoo.  So I am making a suggestion.  This is my favorite shampoo on the market.  Great Price."

I did a lot of research on organic and natural shampoos and this one went on sale so I decided to try it even though I knew there were mixed reviews. Some people have used this product for a long time but recently said its not the same and has been watered down. I think that is the case because my shampoo had a very watery consistency. My main complaint is that I could not get it through my hair. I have fine hair, but A LOT of it. I even sectioned my hair off into three parts to be able to get to the roots better. After a few uses my hair was an oily nasty mess. After I washed my hair it would dry and look super greasy even on the ends! Overall, if you are looking for a more natural shampoo, please look elsewhere and save some money and time! Also, it is good to note this is a non-returnable purchase."

It may be that the company's changed their formula as the product's consistency is much thinner (originally like syrup / now closer to water). Also, it takes a greater quantity to not only create a lather, but also to get the hair clean (now takes 2 shampoos). I contacted the manufacturer's consumer hotline and asked if the formula had been changed or if the product was now thinner - there really wasn't an answer, however, I was offered a discount coupon ($12 as I'd purchased the 32 oz size). Fortunately, Amazon allowed me to return the product and my purchase price was refunded. As the product was sold / shipped by Amazon, I have no way of knowing whether the product was shipped directly from Avalon Organics or an independent distributor. I'll not buy the product again."

When I used the new shampoo I had to use 3-4 times as much on my hair to get the same lather, yet my hair never feels clean. After about a month of use now, my hair is constantly feeling dry and damaged, no matter how much conditioner I use. I am also consistently loosing more and more hair while shampooing.

However, since using it, my hair dries frizzier, and it definitely feels drier, maybe more brittle. This is from air drying. My hair will sometimes curl from air drying, but not with this product. It's not its usual wave either. As I said, it's frizzier, it doesn't have its typical sheen.

If you're wavy like me, odds are you're doing that anyway, so it's fine. My hair was over-moisturized for WEEKS after trying out some Shea Moisture products and the way to balance that out is by adding in some protein. After one single wash I saw major improvement in my curl pattern (it may have taken more washes but I'd already been going weeks without conditioner, etc. to help).

I didn‚Äôt see dramatic improvement in my hair until I started also doing a Shea butter and avocado treatment, and I‚Äôm using a rice water treatment as a pre-wash. Slowly my hair is coming back. Probably once my hair has grown out the less damage part I‚Äôll switch to a different shampoo. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about this is it has a very strong almost bubblegum smell to it.

I have colored, thick, wavy hair. Scent wise, I would almost describe this as a fruit wine. I like it. A little bit of the shampoo goes a long way, lathers really well, even for my thick hair. However, since using it, my hair dries frizzier, and it definitely feels drier, maybe more brittle. This is from air drying. My hair will sometimes curl from air drying, but not with this product. It's not its usual wave either. As I said, it's frizzier, it doesn't have its typical sheen. All that said, I think it's at a good price point (paid 6.97 USD) for the amount of time it's likely to last me. This is why I'm giving it 3 stars."

This is a protein set, protein will dry your hair out and make it brittle if overused or if your hair doesn't like protein. Read up on protein moisture balance! Love this stuff! It's not perfectly curly girl friendly because of a certain silicone, but it's one that is easily taken care of by regular clarifying. If you're wavy like me, odds are you're doing that anyway, so it's fine. My hair was over-moisturized for WEEKS after trying out some Shea Moisture products and the way to balance that out is by adding in some protein. After one single wash I saw major improvement in my curl pattern (it may have taken more washes but I'd already been going weeks without conditioner, etc. to help). The lifeless, greasy frizzy feel is gone.  Smell amazing."

I've used this along side L'Oreal's Elvive deep conditioning, and feel they pair well when alternating. Personally, I love the scent.

Please read my review for Nioxin System 2 conditioner; the review is very relevant. Long story short: I was a loyal user of Nioxin System 2 for years. Then one day the magic stopped; my hair became blah. I jumped off the Nioxin train and started using other popular hair products. I researched what in the heck happened to Nioxin. My hair was the same so something had to have changed with the product. I found lots of comments posted by unhappy users on lots of web sites other than Amazon; although there are lots on Amazon. I read Nioxin was bought by P&G, who in turn, changed the ingredients and moved production to Mexico. But like a long lost love, Nioxin System 2 always held a special place in my heart. One day while perusing Amazon I noticed something different about Nioxin. Some of the products - not all - had new labeling. So I am thinking maybe the product changed also. Now keep in mind, I am talking about the conditioner, although all the product labeling for System 2 has been revamped. I decided to give Nioxin another chance and ordered the conditioner. To my great surprise, my hair returned to its former glory. The conditioner - the stuff with the new labeling - shows it is now made in the USA! The cleanser I bought, with the old labeling, was still made in Mexico but, again, my hair is spectacular. here is the moral of my story - I assume any product with the new labeling is now made in the USA. If you are thinking about ditching Nioxin or left Nioxin because the product of the past sucked, I suggest buying the stuff in the new look bottles and give it another shot. Like me, you might be pleasantly surprised."

There was one review saying that it burned her scalp and another that said it burns their eyes - that's probably why. Salt will strip your hair color out, dehydrate your hair and certainly strip down any keratin or Brazilian treatments in your hair. If the manufacturer could reformulate this to be salt (sodium chloride) free, now THAT would be a winner üåüüôè. I'm giving it 3 stars because it is SLS free. That's a good start, but what you gain in removing harsh surfactants, you lose in adding sodium chloride. I hope the manufacturer's will consider reformulating this product without salt."

I have fine hair, and it doesn't have as much volume as it did when I was younger.  I bought this based on an online recommendation for boosting volume in fine hair.  I feel like it's doing to opposite of what it should.  My hair is more dry on the ends, and it literally falls out in double the amount in the shower.  Although the shampoo makes a good lather with just a tiny amount, my hair feel squeaky when I rinse it out.  How is it possible for hair to feel dried out when it is soaking wet??  I followed with the conditioner, and it softened the hair in the shower a bit. After blow drying, although it looks shiny at the root, it is wispy and brittle looking.  I used the products for 2 weeks, just to see if my hair improved, but it continued to get more dry each time.  I'll stick with my cheap Pantene."

I was really surprised with how long it actually keeps my hair feeling super clean and super thick. I am excited to try the thickening conditioner, as well as, other products from R+Co. The way I found out about this shampoo line is from a sample pack of thickening shampoo and conditioner that I received 'free' with some perfume samples from a department store in Las Vegas. I was traveling and thought I would try out the sample pack and was blown away with the super high quality so when I got back from vacation, I made sure to search Amazon and found this wonderful full size 8.5 oz bottle.

I really loved Sukin Protein shampoo from Australia, but they discontinued it. So I took a chance and tried this, and it works really well.  I don't see a lot of split ends, same as with the Sukin, it leaves my hair smooth. It is not high sudsing, so don't expect that, but it cleans just fine with one lathering, and you don't need to use much at all, so a bottle of this shampoo lasts a long time. So it's worth it to me.

After using the shampoo for over a week, I could tell my hair felt thicker and had more volume. The shampoo was gentle on my scalp and did not dry it out like similar products that I have used. To be honest I am also using this alongside their hair pills, which is how I came to find out about this shampoo. If you have thinning hair and need a shampoo that smells great, gentle on your scalp and actually works - this is the product for you. The only thing they need to improve is to have this in a bigger bottle instead of two small bottles, which is a waste of plastic and creates extra waste for the environment."

My issue has been that I am highly sensitive to scents and strong products so it has been a challenge. I received this product about a week ago and have used 2x already. The scent is faint and disappears a few minutes after application (I was looking for parfum free but it‚Äôs hard to find). The oil is very light and does not weigh your hair down. Most importantly though is that I just have to apply a pea size amount to my palm and rub into my hair before blow drying. Works like a charm! It was hot here today and I was very active and but my hair still looks great. I highly recommend!

I had resorted to using a stripping shampoo once per week, but my hair would be totally dried out afterward, and the buildup would begin immediately the next day. This shampoo left my hair soft yet product-free after just one wash. My hair is noticeably softer, and any trace of greasiness is gone. It doesn't strip everything off to the point that my hair feels totally de-oiled and dried out, like it would after using the stripping shampoo. The only potential drawback for some people might be that it doesn't have a strong pleasant scent that I have noticed with other Nexxus products. Rather, it has a very light scent that reminds me of incense. I use a conditioner from Nexxus that smells of coconuts after using this product, but that's just personal preference. I would absolutely recommend this product if you want softer hair that won't retain product buildup!"

I've never written an Amazon review in my entire life and I probably won't ever again, but I gotta share this in case there's someone out there who it can help. This shampoo saved my god damn head. Literally. Within the past month, I've spent over $100 on shampoos trying to fix an issue I've been experiencing with my hair. I have very thick, oily, and heavy hair that after about 12 hours, feels greasy (and sometimes looks it too). About a month ago I realized I wasn't able to fully wash product out of my head even when using just a little bit and washing it out for 30+ minutes. Every single day after drying my hair for over an hour, I'd find a clump of shampoo/conditioner stuck in the back of my head. I couldn't get this out no matter what treatments I did, no matter what product I used, etc. I went through multiple bottles and brands of shampoos and none of it worked. I then came across this product and bought it as my last hope. I washed with this shampoo two days in a row and my hair no longer has left over product it, it stays soft and light for over 24 hours now, and I can't say enough good things about the consistency and sent of the product itself. If you've experienced any issues like I've had above, I kid you not this shampoo is worth every dollar. If I had just bought this shampoo in the first place I would've saved myself over $100.

Obviously, there is no product that can completely eliminate the problem of having greasy hair. It's important to have realistic expectations. Try using this product for a month and then evaluate your results. I still need to use dry shampoo, but I have tried a lot of products and have found nothing better than this. It's also important to follow the instructions. Massage slowly into scalp and let sit for 2-3 minutes. Repeat process. You must do this process twice or you will not see the results you're looking for. You'll notice the first time you put it in, there will be little to no foam/soap.

My honest review of this shampoo is that it's fine. I'm a guy with short hair, so I only need to use a small amount of this shampoo. I leave it on for the 2-3 minutes suggested, but do not do a second application and rinse because it really does not seem necessary. The product succeeds in leaving my hair feeling clean and does seem to work at doing some degreasing. You MUST use conditioner on the tips of your hair every time after using this shampoo, because it does leave your hair feeling very dry. I'm also not a big fan of the smell, but it's not bad, just not something I would ever buy or wear for the scent alone. Luckily, my conditioner and other hair product take care of that. It's only been a week, so I will come back when it's been a few more weeks, but for now, it's not made anything worse, but it will take some more results for me to come back for a second purchase when I use this bottle up."

My hair was brittle and seemed always dry no matter what products I would put on it. I thought that I would have had to cut my hair and start completely over. However, when my products arrived, I could not wait to give them a try. I love the smells. Very nice and not powerful. I washed my hair twice with the Nexxus Shampoo, first time just the scalp, and the second wash, the hair itself. The way that my hair reacted to this shampoo was breathtaking! My curls appeared and believe it or not, I was able to pull a comb through my thick, natural, 4C  hair!! I have never, ever been able to do this before while washing. Barely any hair was coming out in my comb! I had not even used the conditioner yet. I just had to stop and look in the mirror and talk to myself saying, ""Omg, I cannot believe this""! I have never, ever experienced a shampoo doing my hair like this before. After I completely rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I moved on to the Nexxus Conditioner. Even more amazing. It stated to leave on the hair for 3 min, but I sat under a hooded dryer for about 10min with the conditioner on my hair, under a plastic cap. Once my time was up, I rinsed away all of the conditioner. My hair was so manageable!! I was able to comb and section it to do my bantu knots and allow my hair to dry overnight. After washing my hair, it only took me about 30 min to get it  all done to dry. I have never been able to complete this process this quickly before! I am highly satisfied with these products! Even though they are  expensive products, I'm hooked and will be purchasing again. I told my mom about my experience and am ready to try it on her hair also, to see if she gets the same experience and satisfaction that I got. Thank you Nexxus for such wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them. Definitely a must try on the Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner for Severely damaged hair. This is my first time ever writing a review on a product. That's how pleased I was with these products!!"

Out of the hundreds of samples received throughout the years, this was the first product I was compelled to buy. My hair was dry and lifeless. This shampoo/conditioner makes my hair shiny and so soft. I've used more shampoos than I can count and this is the first to give me noticeable results after just one use. I will say that if you are sensitive to perfume smells, this may be too strong for you. I enjoy the sent and the fact that my hair holds that sent beyond 24 hours. Even after using a different shampoo for a day, the smell of this one still comes through. Also, if you are prone to greasy hair, this may make it worse. I do not have this issue typically, but at the end of the day after using this, there is a subtle heaviness to my roots. All of this being said, this is my new favorite beauty product."

I will say that I was worried at first while I was washing my hair because it felt ‚Äúheavy‚Äù and like my hair would be greasy as someone else in the reviews had stated. I do have thin hair so this is a concern. However what you need to know is that as soon as you put the conditioner on that feeling disappears so make sure you condition all the way to your roots. I know that‚Äôs typically not recommended but I believe this shampoo and conditioner are made to treat and repair the entire hair strand. Also, it smells amazing. The thing I would compare the smell to is the Moroccan hair treatment oils that are out there. Very pleasant and it lasts after styling which I like because I love to smell good! If you‚Äôre unsure whether you‚Äôll like this shampoo then buy the smaller bottles first. And remember to use the shampoo and conditioner together and your hair will turn out smooth and shiny!"

Had solid reviews and it‚Äôs a well known brand so I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. After about 2-3 weeks of using it, I noticed that my hair was falling out more than normal. I typically blow dry my hair (because every guy should) and saw more hair falling out. I didn‚Äôt actually see it falling out but when I would put product in my hair, I would see around 6-7 pieces of hair on my hand after. Normally I would see maybe 2 after applying product. Also, after showering, I would notice a lot of my hair around the drain and was worried. This shampoo was the only thing I changed during that time and I‚Äôve stopped using it. My hair is very thick to begin with but I could tell it was definitely thinner and felt as if it just had a hair cut. Mind you male pattern baldness does not run in my family nor mothers and my fathers hair is like a helmet which does not thin, only turns grey. I digress. Do not buy this shampoo.

Unlike L'Oreal and Matrix (which look nearly identical in color despite one being a purple shampoo and the other supposedly a ""blue"" shampoo,) this product obviously contains rich, deep blue pigment. I personally lather it into my hair and leave it in for five minutes or so before rinsing to really give the pigment a chance to penetrate my hair. There are noticeable results from using both the shampoo and the conditioner after one wash, but the cumulative results over time are much better. It does a great job of toning even the stubbornest orange in my hair."

I think it brightens my gray but it did not have the effect I hoped for in extending my purple highlights.

She couldn't understand what was wrong when she started using this latest product in a new bottle. It took her a while, trying it over and over again, before she realized that there is something seriously wrong with this shampoo. It seems to have no soap, it leaves her hair feeling flat and greasy. No body at all. Nothing like the way the shampoo has worked for over 10 years. Unfortuantely, by the time she realized the problem was truly the shampoo, and not anything else, it was too late to return the product for a refund. I posted this complaint previously, but it was removed by Amazon because I said that this is either a fake product or Redkin has made an awful change. Amazon checked into the matter and just wrote back to say that they confirmed this is not a fake product. That is why they removed my previous complaint. That is good to know, and I appreciate Amazon getting back to me. That is helpful. But this problem is so severe that it is worth adding this new comment. Unfortunately, as I see it, this leaves only two alternatives: Redkin has ruined the formula so badly that it isn't even close to being the same. Or, perhaps this was just a bad batch. If I don't hear anything back, I will assume it was not a mistake and it is time to find a new brand. If anyone can recommend a substitute, please let me know. Thanks."

But, smells good and as a licensed cosmetologist, I xan say that the tingly feeling helped loosen my scalp to massage my scalp during shampoo. (Massage keeps blood flow to decrease un-natural hairloss.) I also used the matching conditioner. Which also gave a very good tingly feel. Now for those who hair is naturally dry, do not run from this product. Purchase a good conditioning hair mask and apply before the matching contioner or after which ever you perfer. I do before to hydrate easier. When your out add some hydrating leave in creams. One of my favorite is butter cream by ""As I Am"". For Ethnic hair types I would not use this product everyday, due to the drying effect it gives. I would love to see the makes create a product that moisturizes as well for ethnic hair or even create a hair mask for dry hair. Even for Caucasian hair I would use a light pea size oil on palm when done, rub vigorously on palm and add to whole hair to keep the fly aways from looking like a over permed 80's curls. Overall I gave a 4 stars due to the overdrying effect it gives (that is to any hair type) but for Caucasian the conditioner should give a 5 syar effect. Would I purchase again? So far yes. I always do a re-review after a couple months. I feel this product is good for a youtube channel review, so I may do it there as well. Review would be if this product actually works? So far honest review after one wash I would purchase again."

I used to use Nizoral shampoo that my dermatologist recommended, as I also have scalp oiliness and dandruff associated with my hair loss.

I‚Äôve been using the Nioxin system at the recommendation of a hair stylist for almost a year now, and I don‚Äôt plan on ever using anything else. It has kept my scalp in really great condition and is gentle enough to use daily. I can‚Äôt say it helps with hair loss necessarily, but I have seen more baby hairs growing recently so maybe it does a little. Mainly it will help with the overall appearance of your hair loss. It makes hair look super clean and thus thicker when you‚Äôre using it. Sometimes it can be hard to make thinner hair look clean as it always wants to look stringy. So it‚Äôs definitely helped with that. I would recommend giving it a shot if you have dandruff or hair loss issues."

I used these products a few days before my college homecoming.  The compliments just kept coming.  These products worked very well for my hair type.  I am aware that some people stated that the products didn't work well for them.  I used the products as specified per the directions as well as watched several videos of the products used mostly successfully as well as some unsuccessfully.  I was more than pleased with the outcome of my hair.  It was so bouncy, shiny, and full of life.  It looked so healthy and felt amazing.  It only lasted for about a week, could have been longer if it did not rain where I am.  The moisture in the air caused my hair to not hold a curl easily, however, it did not completely draw up, it still took a week or more to revert back to my natural curl on its own.  I eventually just wet it so it would curl up in its natural state.  I also tried it in my daughter's hair, using the same process.  It lasted for all of a day because she's very active and sweated it out, however for special events, I will use these products for our natural hair to switch it up a bit.  I really enjoyed the change and am looking forward to using this product again.  Incidentally, this isn't like a perm, where you can only use it every 6 - 8 weeks, you can use it every time you want your hair straight and it won't damage it.  The shampoo does make your hair feel a little dryer than usual, but the silk conditioner compensates for that once you rinse the shampoo out and apply the conditioner.  Your hair really will feel like silk after one application.  Some people resolve to use just the conditioner as a detangling formula, but since that isn't my issue, I am more than happy to use all the products as recommended to get the desired effect.  E'tae ROCKS!!!"

I have thin hair and have had some work done at Bosley and this shampoo works very well for me. It cleans my hair without stripping it and my hair feels great and very manageable. The Brews Daily shampoo is also very ight and it doesn't weigh my hair down so myr hair looks great all day. I still have some Go Clean left and tried it a couple of days ago to see the difference in the two shampoos and feel that the new blend of Brews Daily is better.

I have silky fine thick hair that is often just limp and fizzy. This shampoo help clean away all the junk that weighs it down and provides a bit of shiny volume without the frizz.  I don't need to use more than a nickel /quarter-sized amount to wash for my medium long hair. I do occasionally wash twice if I skipped a day to wash my hair. Definitely use a small amount of the complimenting conditioner to help smooth hair and minimize tangling. Do comb your hair before washing, I find it helps minimize tangles and snarls too. DELIVERY REVIEW: Kudos to the people for getting my shampoo to me. I wasn't suppose to get it for another month and it surprisingly arrived today!! I have been using a moisturizing shampoo that was just too much for my poor scalp because this was out-of-stock at all the local stores. Thank and Blessings to everyone working so hard to get items out to us. }}hugss{{"

For the first time in years my head is not a salt shaker! It took about 2 weeks for me to notice a difference. I had also purchased the scalp lotion , but I do not like it. Very hard to work into the scalp with thick hair. The shampoo however is very good. Not much odor, it‚Äôs pleasant. Takes just a small amount to work into the hair and scalp. Allow to remain for 3-5 minutes. I use this a minimum of 3 times a week, as I have fairly short hair, I work out daily and sweat a lot.

Unfortunately, it did the complete opposite. Not only did it leave my scalp dry and itchy it did not remove the sebum buildup, made it worse, right and created little pimple like bumps on my scalp and around my hairline. Also, even with using a great conditioner it left my hair crunchy, not easy to comb through and flat. Ugh! Also note, beside the sulfates, which I really didn‚Äôt mind, there is Sodium Benzoate which is actually worse and is carcinogenic. Also the description of this shampoo is VERY deceiving. You think all of those amazing botanicals are going to be in the shampoo and they are not. They are in the scalp lotion which I also purchased. I will write a separate review for that as well. Lastly, it is really disappointing because I am fully supportive of women owned companies as I own one myself. Unfortunately when people don‚Äôt practice what they preach, that is really disappointing. All that research, etc to go into this product to result in using horrible toxic ingredients.

Kamedis so far keeps the itchiness away in between washes (every other day) and the flakes are much less now. Seborrhea never gave me a lot of flakes, it was always more the itch and the crusting that bothered me, so something to keep it toned down is essential. I will keep using Kamedis as long as it's effective, and just hope it stays effective for a long time."

I use the Davines Minu conditioner with it and the two together leave my hair silky-soft even when I just air dry it. I know some reviewers have noted the Davines products sold on Amazon as being fake, but I have been ordering this shampoo once a month for 2 years or so and it's never varied in color, quality, texture, etc. I used to get Davines from my salon and I never noticed a difference between the product I bought there and the one I get off Amazon.

It's creamy enough where my thickness is nurtured and it cleans thoroughly so it's not weighed down. So hard to find anything that addresses both, thank you for offering it at a cheaper price!!"

Within 2 days of not washing it, it would start to get greasy and my scalp would start getting itchy, irritated and flaky. If I tried to push through to 3 or 4 days without washing, my hair would become a greasy mess and my scalp would get extremely irritated. I finally determined I might need to try a better shampoo and went with this Pura D‚Äôor stuff. I‚Äôve used one of their other products in the past and found it to be really good salon quality stuff for less than typical salon quality prices. Anyway, this shampoo is was what my scalp and hair were wanting. I can now easily go 4-5 days between hair washing, which is my preferred frequency, my scalp doesn‚Äôt bother me at all, and my hair is a lot less greasy and looks way better. The shampoo smells great too. I‚Äôll keep using this stuff forever if they continue making it and keep it at a good price."

I dont know if it's hormonal, nutritional, or what, but it's always been isolated to my scalp so I never went so far as to get a derm appointment. I thought I was doing right by using coal tar stuff for years to keep it somewhat at bay but it recently dawned on me that it may be contributing to hair loss, so I decided to find an alternative. This is it. There is a scent to it that some would consider to be like cleaner but crisp and clean smelling. And it way better on the hair. I've used for a week, my DANDRUFF IS GONE GUYS. Pricier than I would like but I obviously need it so worth it in my opinion. The texture is a bit loose but don't let that fool you into thinking its weak. Make sure to really work on to scalp and leave it for a minute or two, massage, etc. And it's been so good on my hair. Pair with a good conditioner."

Four days later I still have no flaking or itching, whereas those symptoms would have returned already when I was using ketoconazole and pyrithone zinc. Of course, I am sure I will still need to use the Pura D'Or shampoo periodically, but I am impressed at how well it has worked so far. It does has a strong, distinctive smell, probably owing to the essential oils in it, but I think those very compounds are what makes it so effective."

I chose the apple cider vinegar scent because of the ""harsh swimming conditions"", and due to it being summer, I thought this would help maintain frizz.  Apple cider vinegar has always made me nauseous, but this shampoo doesn't have a smell (unless you're trying to smell for it, then you can BARELY smell the ACV).  I wash my hair once a week with this scent and use The Honest Co.'s fragrance free lavender conditioner with it.  I also use a shower cap on the days I'm not washing my hair to prevent the shower's humidity and accidental splashes from making my scalp itch.  This has become a DREAM COMBO for me!

He uses it and loves it. I would rather not smell like a boy so I have been trying other ones. Keep reading if you want to know about others. We only use the conditioner. The sunflower is the strongest smelling one yet! Oat Milk blend was probably my fav but weak smell. Kefir prebiotic reminded me of baby products with a rose smell to them so I am not a fan. And blackberry was the most sweet fruit smelling and very yummy. But all three of these have such a weak smell in comparison to the sunflower conditioner it is like it was made by a different company. The strong smell is why I think it only gets 3 stars and those three stars are a stretch for me since I'd throw it out if it wasn't for my husband using it. I just wish the others had a longer lasting and stronger smell and then I'd like them.

I have super thick hair that I honestly only wash once a week after straightening and curling it and doing periodic touch ups ( and then I add dry shampoo when necessary).

It's kind of hard to describe the smell, but that's what it reminds me of and to me it's a little subtle. Now as far as the glitter sticking to the hair, it sticks more to your hands than the hair and I've tried putting less than a pea size on my fingers and rubbing it through my daughter's hair and it does get gunky in some spots that's hard to even out. This was the first time I bought this and it will probably be the last. My daughter likes the smell of it and she has gotten compliments on her hair smelling nice from her teachers.

You should use it with the Keritan leave in conditioner . I live in Flirida and have fine wavy hair that becomes unmanageable frizz when humidity strikes. I have tried all types of products. Years ago Paul Brown straightening worked because it left body in your hair. Then I tried salon Keratin straightening and ended up with stick straight hair.  So many shampoos later I found this shampoo and leave in serum. This is perfect . I leave in my hair in the shower for a few minutes. I bought a big toothed comb to hang on my shower and I comb it through after shampooing. Then after a few minutes in rinse . I put in two squeezes of leave in serum ( I have shoulder length hair). Then I take the comb and comb through.  I blow dry after 10 minutes of air drying. My hair is soft and straight . The humidity doesn‚Äôt make it wavy. I found if I exercise out door and my hair gets wet from sweat ( and I don‚Äôt have time to wash) I put one squeeze in and dry on low setting and I am back to straight hair with plenty of body.

It had started to look really greasy, stuck to my head, and almost spongy feeling. I did a little research and realized that my hair is in desperate need of protein, but because I have low porosity hair protein can actually do more damage then good (especially keratin for me). I found this, and it's been great. It has soy protein, and it's like #6 on the list of ingredients which makes it so it's not protein overload. Also because it's a shampoo the protein is actually able to penetrate my low porosity hair. My hair is starting to get it's volume back. If you find that this shampoo works great at first, but then your hair starts to dry out and get crunchy it's because it doesn't want anymore protein. Just take a break from using it. The conditioner doesn't contain protein tho, so that's always fine to use."

I also always go for the most moisturizing shampoos and conditioners I can find especially in the winter. I generally use a leave-in conditioner or detangler after shampooing (and since Burt's Bees doesn't have one of those for humans I've used Mane and Tail's detangler spray). Yesterday my hair looked AMAZING but it felt very blergh, which sort of makes sense because I've read that dirty hair actually holds a hairstyle better than clean hair. I read another review from someone who said they felt like their hair was both shampooed and conditioned with just this shampoo, and on the theory that I might have overconditioned my hair yesterday I used the spray detangler sparingly today. It still doesn't feel clean, and going back to what I just said, if my hair doesn't feel clean I'm going to be sitting there wishing I could stop what I'm doing, find a flow of clean water somewhere and shampoo my hair. Which isn't really conducive to doing social events that involve presenting myself as a functioning human being to other people. For me, my hair has to be clean first, and looking a certain way is gravy. Unfortunately, this shampoo isn't fulfilling that for me. Sorry, Burt's Bees, I really wanted to love this shampoo and I gave you two stars because my hair did look good yesterday and because I appreciate your social responsibility as I read it on the shampoo label."

Unfortunately red colors oxidize faster than other colors and for me this color extend shampoo helps keep my color brighter longer.  I frankly quit trying other shampoos long ago because they just didn't seem to work as well for me.  I also like buying the liter (get a pump too!)  because it lasts me about a year and I don't spend as much on smaller bottles that cost more and don't seem to last as long.  Its a good buy for.

Yesss, the tingleness is amazing, but I really love it for what it does to my hair. I've struggled with build up in my hair lately (obviously im not a ""Go Green on every product"" kind of girl), so I've been looking for something that I can use every so often to give my scalp a really good cleanse. Ive tried many shampoos that have that mint that cleanses, removes build up and opens your scalp pores, so I must say this has done the job!  Im not saying this product is THE BEST, but I am saying its AMAZING! and it leaves my hair weightless and full! definitely recommend it."

I just wore this to work last night and my hair feels really healthy and it does seem to be safe to use daily without killing your scalp. I do want to give a 4.5 rating because the scent does smell a little too synthetic, but everyone else complimented the smell so maybe it was just me. Overall I rounded up to a 5 because it is a great product and I'll order again from this company."

I saw a dermatologist who suggested that I try Targum as well as other prescription strength shampoos and treatments. These did not work for me. I resorted to rinsing with diluted apple cider vinegar and that seemed to  heal some of my scalp flakiness, redness, and scaling but never for very long, simply for getting the symptoms under control. I found out about this Sachajuan shampoo while researching my next remedy and someone mentioned it in a post for another product. I don't know how else I would have found it. It works perfectly. After the first wash i noticed a difference and after the second I no longer had the persistent signs of dandruff. At all. I have been using this about twice a week for two months and my scalp is now healthy. My hair is also much brighter and softer. The scent is lovely and the bottle is packaged beautifully and doesn't scream ""dandruff shampoo"". I am so grateful that I found this and i hope that they don't change formula and that it continues to work well for me. I will continue to buy this as my regular shampoo and will eventually try the conditioner too."

Since having my second child, I have had severely oily hair in certain spots (behind the ears, underneath in the back). I can only surmise that it is due to hormonal changes after giving birth. I had tried everything, and switched shampoos multiple times. I was buying Nexxus because it was the only thing that came close to giving me a ""clean"" after shower feel. Even so, I would wash then dry my hair (a lengthy process for those with long hair) and still it would be oily. I was beyond frustrated. Finally I came across this shampoo while doing some heavy research, and it has solved the problem. It is pricey, and as others have said it is difficult to lather, so you end up using more. But it is worth it to me to have a scalp free of oil, without the damage of drying out my hair. Not sure if it's worth mentioning, but I have dyed blonde hair, and have had zero issues. So very thankful for this product."

I normally don‚Äôt have any so it was really a surprise that one day it looked like it was snowing from my head. It was so bad that I was nervous of getting haircut and having them think something was wrong with my scalp! After seeing that I did the first thing most people would do: go to the store and buy some head and shoulders. After using that for a couple of weeks, I didn‚Äôt notice any improvement. I then tried tea tree oil, but didn‚Äôt notice any improvement there either. I made an appointment with my dermatologist and she prescribed me shampoo, but I didn‚Äôt notice any improvement there either. I scoured the internet and somehow ran into this. It was expensive, but I was pretty desperate so I bit the bullet and gave it try. Within a few days it started getting better. My sister recommended I use the Aussie 3 minute miracle stuff for conditioner as well. Between those two I have not had any dandruff in a year. Now, I did move to California and had run out of this stuff but I did still have my conditioner so I used Dove moisturizing shampoo for a week, but sure enough my scalp was dry and the dandruff was coming back. I freaked out and bought this all over again. I will probably never switch. This story really works or at least it really did for me."

I'm currently wearing passion twist crochet and would shampoo my hair once every 7 to 10 days. I use this shampoo with a scalp massager and these two products are a must when your hair is braided. Then I condition my scalp and then afterwards I would apply argan oil to my scalp. My scalp is dry and would have flakes/dandruff and on top of that product-build up so I needed a shampoo that would gently exfoliate my scalp, removing the dead skin, and styling products without stripping the natural oils from the scalp or hair folicles. It's pricey but I understand that the higher price point is from the high quality, plant-derived ingredients."

It‚Äôs a formaldehyde, though it‚Äôs widely used in beauty product as an anti microbial. If that‚Äôs a worry then this is not for you, however I‚Äôm ok with living dangerously. I like a lot of OGX shampoos but this one tends to put moisture where you don‚Äôt need it which is closer to the scalp and none where you do need it which is on the ends of your hair. I suspect any porosity in your hair can‚Äôt hold it and it rinses out. I‚Äôve got pretty fine hair and prefer the roots of my hair to be pretty squeaky clean to get some root lift which this doesn‚Äôt achieve. Of course it smells nice, but that‚Äôs about all I like.

Head and Shoulders Clinical Anti-Itch shampoo and spray solved the problem. I have been using them for the past year and my scalp is totally clear. However, the daily use of H&S dried my hair out to straw. I took a gamble after reading reviews of Aveeno's Cotton Blend and purchased the Shampoo and Conditioner. I have been terrified to try anything on my scalp, but Aveeno Cotton Blend worked. The combination balanced the PH level in my scalp and now my hair is starting to return to normal. The Aveeno formulas do not irritate my scalp: no itching, no bumps, no burning. I think it is the Oatmeal that calms my scalp. The smell is nice, not too strong. I am sticking with Aveeno."

Although my hair is thick and almost impossible to damage, it just won't curl, won't straighten--basically won't do anything but poof and take years (and cost hundreds of dollars) to braid.  By the time I was 15 years old, I learned to braid my hair myself (to save money) and either wore braids or shaved my hair super short, because those were the only ways I could quickly manage my hair everyday.  I was given some of O.R.S.'s olive oil samples at a beauty supply store while buying extensions to braid my hair one day.  On a whim, I decided to wash, condition, and moisturize my hair with only the olive oil samples.  I was AMAZED at how soft and manageable my hair was after.  I decided to add a dab of curling mousse just to see what would happen, and I haven't braided my hair sense.  I have a wonderful, curly, natural 'do that doesn't frizz or poof with every subtle climate change.  I have never had so many compliments on my hair before in my life (and I usually get a lot of compliments for my braids).  These products are pure gold AND they're so reasonsably-priced!  I'm not realy one to suggest beauty products to my friends and family because I feel like everyone is different and different things work for different people, but I haven't met a person yet who couldn't use SOME organic root stimulator hair product. I've told all of my friends and family about them, and everyone who has tried the products have loved them.  They work on all kinds of African American hair--natural, relaxed, texturized, even curl-perms.  And I've even read reviews from people of other ethnic backgrounds raving about the products, so DEFINITELY try them!  And if you don't like them (HIGHLY UNLIKELY), you will not have even lost $10; you can't go wrong!"

My family goes through a lot of the Head and Shoulders and it can get pretty pricey.  4 big bottles at around 20.00 was a great deal, less than half of what I had been paying.  With all of the positive reviews I decided to give it a try.  I have to admit, I am pretty impressed so far.  It arrived very well packaged and secured so I am comfortable ordering it online in the future.  I opened it up and it smells really nice.  Very fresh and similar to the other brand we were using.  I put it in the shower and normally my kids will tell me that other store brands do not work as well, but so far, no one has said anything and they are all using it!  It lathers and rinses very well, it smells great, and it WORKS!!  So far I have noticed no itching since we switched.  I am very pleased with it!  And I have to say again, this price for a large size medicated dandruff shampoo is unbeatable.  I am very happy with this purchase!"

I found out long ago doing woodwork that I'm allergic to western red cedar. This product left my scalp with a burning sensation, no doubt due to the cedar oil in the formula. There's a reason bugs won't eat cedar, it's toxic to them. Also, the product is thin and I needed a lot to get my hair clean. My hair was left limp and feeling coated, not at all volumized as advertised. I had great hopes, this company being part of the Hain group but they seem to be trading on the word ""organics"" in their name. I have since found Maple Holistics Degrease shampoo, which does live up to the ""holistics"" in their name. It's great stuff and I won't be buying Avalon Organics products again."

The smell lingers for days after I've watched it, which is amazing! I love the coconut scent so much, even though I'm usually not a big fan of coconut. The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling soft and moisturized, and I also like that the ingredients are more natural. It is a good price for a more natural shampoo compared to other ones I have bought before. However, the shampoo does not clean my hair thoroughly. My hair is very fine and thin, so it doesn't seem like it would be that difficult for the shampoo to penetrate all my hair, but after I wash it, the top layer looks clean, but underneath is still greasy! I even will shampoo my hair 2 or sometimes  times very thoroughly, but my hair still is grimey feeling underneath! I'm so dissappointed because I love everything else about this shampoo and conditioner. But I have to use to much of the shampoo every time, and it doesn't even clean my hair properly. I'm not really sure why it is like this, because I have used sulfate-free shampoos before and never had a problem with them."

Be aware when you first open this and use it, the shampoo is extremely watery. It‚Äôs not the goopy, slimy texture you‚Äôre used to in most all shampoos. It looks like purple water. This would make you think you need to use more, but beware! The bottle says to use a small amount, and they mean it! The shampoo lathers up and spreads very, very well. I have long, thick hair, and I use a fraction of the amount I am used to using. Once it lathers up, it feels quite luxurious and does a much better job of moisturizing than most shampoos I‚Äôve used. It‚Äôs suprising and amazing. It does a decent job of keeping the hair from yellowing, and I use it daily. I also use the conditioner and hair mask from the same brand, and the products seem to work well together to keep my hair toned and moisturized. My hair is in much better condition than before I started using these."

So much so that I decided to keep my natural color even after the salon reopened! This shampoo is rich, so you only need a small handfull for medium length and weight hair, and have a very mild fragrance.

I thought it would  lather up better in my hand.  I wet my hair in the shower and applied it to the roots of my hair and worked it outward.  It required that I add additional water to my hair to lather up whereas bottled shampoo I would not have to do that.  The smell was challenging for me.  I rinsed my hair and did not use conditioner (I typically do use conditioner).  It was not easy to comb through my hair.  When my hair dried, it did look pretty good and the smell was very mild.  The next day I repeated everything but this time I used my normal conditioner.  My hair was easier to comb through and softer.  I would bring this on vacation because it is easy to pack but I'm not sure that I would use it on a regular basis because I really don't like the smell when shampooing.

The bar fits snugly in the rest of the area and doesn't bounce around.

It has a very strong odor and can tend to make my fine hair frizzy.  It does work well but it's a little harsh and requires deep conditioning after using.  I use Redken shampoo and conditioner on a regular basis--it's the only brand I trust.  So, when I found this product, I immediately purchased it with the hope that I could replace the Neutrogena shampoo.  First, the name is a little misleading.  It is indeed a shampoo, not a cream.  The scent is very light and the shampoo lathers but doesn't feel harsh.  I also used Redken All Soft Mega Mask to condition after washing. When my hair dried, it was shiny, soft, bouncy and manageable. My scalp felt moisturized as well.  I could tell the build-up was gone because the color was lighter.  In conclusion, I had much better results than Neutrogena.  If you have fragile, fine hair I would highly recommend this product.  * P.S., I used this shampoo to prepare my hair for color treatment.  Wow! What a difference this makes! My hair took the color more evenly and it took the color to a  lighter shade, which is optimal. Hair is shiny and soft. I'm in love üòç"

I used an entire bottle of the Aveeno coconut dry skin relief body wash, and I decided to buy this to restock. I like it because it's very lightly scented, which is good if your skin is sensitive. It's also still really hydrating and pleasant to use. The scent isn't amazing or anything, but the soap does the job so I don't mind!! I recommend this for people who have very dry, sensitive skin like me (but I recommend the coconut one more if your skin isn't that sensitive because it smells a lot nicer and is a little more hydrating). It's even better if you can lock in the moisture with a lotion right after your shower, but even if you can't do that, it still works really well!"

This cleanser would be good for normal/combination/dry/sensitive/rosacea/eczema skin types.

While I'm not saying this product is a cure-all, I can say that, for my sensitive skin family, it doesn't dry out the skin the same way that other products have, and, though you will probably still need body lotion/oil, you won't need more to compensate for a moisture-stripping body wash."

But no sign of any skin problems where i am applying it. Now I am washing almost all with this. It keeps me clean longer.

Amazing. The best soap EVER.  I originally purchased it because it was such a great value. I didn‚Äôt expect to fall in love with a soap.  But, I did. It cleans hands beautifully. As a nurse, I know what covers dirt, or masks orders by a potent sent.  But not this. Especially with Covid around, I want my hands , and body, as clean as possible . Many soaps can clean your clean off dirt. But, they leave your body dry and chapped. . Dry and chapped skin is considered an opened wound when it comes it viruses and bacteria entering your body. So it‚Äôs imperative that  your body is cleaned of all possible  bacteria as well as viruses.  However, if your soap does that, and leaves your skin chapped and/ or extremely dry, you are actually setting yourself up for increased susceptibility to all viruses and bacteria.  That is NOT what you want. Especially with Covid.  Mr Teals cleans but also moistens your body.  This is absolutely my new and only body wash. I have also purchased some for my adult children.

        ",Verified Purchase,,"I love this product. My husband somehow goes through a bottle of body wash per week, but with this large size bottle, I don't have to change it out as frequently.  For one, the bottle holds a lot of product, and two, the pump dispenses a normal amount of body wash, minimizing the amount my husband uses.  The scent is a fairly neutral 'clean' scent, so we are both fine using this product. This means one less bottle of product taking up real estate in the shower.

I recently decided to give a natural soap a try after noticing that my skin has become very sensitive to many things. Of course to begin with I just thought I needed a soap with ""extra moisturizers"" or something fancy like that, but it wasn't cutting it. I began to surf across amazon to see what the highest rated natural/organic body washes were, and this one was the top of the list. The reviews were supremely positive and the main thing that caught my eye was how many people were stating that this soap left their skin feeling soft, smooth, and hydrated. After purchasing, the product arrived VERY quickly, which I was happy with as always. I have now used this soap on three separate occasions, not only just on the body but on the face as well. Like the other reviewers, I noticed that upon leaving the shower, I didn't have that ridiculously uncomfortable ""need to put on lotion now"" feeling. My legs were usually craving some sort of moisturizer when I stepped out of the shower, but it seems to have subsided with this product. The soap lathers well, goes a long way (I feel that 1-2 pumps is perfect for the entire body) and smells absolutely INCREDIBLE. I am in love with the natural list of ingredients and am very excited to see how this plays out in the future, as well as recommending it to others in my family. I definitely think I'll be continuing to make this body wash one of my ""Healthy Splurges""."

So while it does feel and smell nice when I shower, the smell doesn't linger for too long afterwards which is rather disappointing but understandable. Another thing I'd like to point out is this is a shower gel instead of a wash so a lot does come out and is needed in order to make it start to foam up but I still have plenty after a few months so it lasts quite a while. It does a pretty good job at moisturizing my body compared to some other products as well as neutralizing odors for a few hours after use."

I went to a popular grocery store(I had to get out for a bit!!) and just happened to see the same body wash. It's pretty good for the cheaper price.

I can't give you an honest opinion on how moisturizing this soap is. Normally when trying something new, I skip the oil but I forgot this time. I've tried much more expensive brands and they're thicker and creamer but for the price I paid, it was pretty good stuff."

You push it down on the initial plunge and you have to pull it up to get the second attempt to give you enough soap.  It does not offer moisturizer.  It honestly dries your skin.

Which makes it alright if you want to use a perfume or colonge.  But I definitely have to use a moisturizer.

The two together was taking every bit of energy my body had until I discovered this. Purely by accident by the way. Now I do not know if this was the only thing that knocked it out or if it was due to the host of other natural remedies I was trying as well but I can say.... THIS WAS THE ONLY THING THAT TAMED THE INFLAMMATION AND IRRITATION. After two weeks of combating candida and four years of bacteria, even after I got rid of the issue, the irritation was still there. Now as I stated before I don't know if this did it alone but I also was taking epsom salt soaks with 100% organic lavender and bathing with ""REMEDY SOAP"", applying coconut oil mixed 100% organic tea tree oil to the affected area, taking candida complex, garlique, vitamin c, and acidophilus as well as drinking a host of water and modifying my diet to reduce ""not eliminate"" carbs, starches, and sugars. I know it sounds like a lot but it really wasn't in comparison to suffering for four years. ALL in ALL I went to the doctor to be sure the candida was gone and found out the bacteria was gone as well. So I got a 2 for 1. I continue to bath with ""REMEDY SOAP"" and take Candida Complex and garlique for safe measures but I AM A BELIEVER!!!! TRY IT AND YOU WONT TURN BACK....."

The Crimson Oak Body Wash is no exception. I have used several Everyman Jack products. From body wash, shampoo and aftershave to moisturizers, beard oil and balms.

The fact that they are produced in USA and are animal and eco friendly is icing on the cake. The prices are very reasonable for a premium product as well. Kick it up a notch and spoil yourself.

I was able to go to bed that night without itching.  I've been using it for every shower and it has made a huge difference.  As I've aged, my skin has grown dryer and dryer, and this is even helping with keeping my hands moisturized during the day.  It comes out like baby oil (without making the tub slippery), and I had initially used it with a washcloth, but that seems to impede the ability to spread it around.  Use it without a washcloth and it spreads better.  Again, does not make the shower/tub slippery.  I've been using another brand I've been faithful to for years now that is gentle, as I have allergic reactions to body soap with junk dyes and fragrance.

In 2014, he had a major skin breakout that took us several doctor visits to diagnose.  Two doctors diagnosed him with eczema and referred us to a specialist.  The physicians were adamant that skin conditions are extremely hard to treat.  They wanted us to realize that this would not be easy.  The doctor gave us samples of two products.  One sample was this product and the other was Aquaphor Baby Wash & Shampoo.  We use the Eucerin in the bath water and the Aquaphor to wash our munchkin.  It worked! No pricey specialist, medications, or creams.  This did the trick and has work for years.  When the weather changes and we have more severe flair ups we use CeraVe Moisturizing Cream.  The doctor will sometimes prescribe a prescription steroid to mix with it.  These three things have been life savers for our little boy.  Skin conditions are tough to treat. Medications and treatment can be extremely expensive and often yield no benefit.  This is a review from a mom that these products work.  Yes, the Eucerin is oily.  It's an oil to moisturize the skin.  No, we have not ever had problems with it smelling, but I guess that's more of an individual biased.  That said, it doesn't have a bad smell or a great smell.  It's really plain, but if you think scented products typically cause more problems.  The bottom line it works."

Things were going along well until my husband moved the Dr. Bronner's from the bathtub; and the Mrs. Meyer's Honeysuckle hand soap was closest. I was *amazed* at how soft and moisturized my skin was afterwards, probably due to the Olive oil.

I live with my husband, 2 sons, and 2 male dogs...and well, I'm seriously out-numbered in the peeny-weeny department.  I love all my boys dearly, but quite frankly, they stink.  Sorry, but it's true.  And Mrs. Meyers Lemon Verbena is the only cleaner that has got the power to cut the stink completely, so that it my deep-clean staple.  After a day of deep-cleaning, I always want to go take a nice hot shower so I do not smell like I've been cleaning all day...and well, the lemon-verbena body wash is kind of counter productive in that task.  So, while the body wash itself is great, I really have to say no to this scent while bathing.  The honeysuckle and lavender washes are much more suited to not smelling like I've been cleaning all day."

Well, those are famous last words.  This does NOT lather at all.  The tube isnt the biggest out there, but thats fine since I knew the size I was purchasing.  However I basically squeezed out half the tube, and still could not get this ""soap"" to lather.  You can use a small dollop of Taylor of Old Bond Street, or The Art of Shaving to get a massive lather.  This however, was an absolute mess.  HALF THE TUBE, and I still could not get a lather.  All I could manage was a runny soapy mess.  Fortunately it was slick enough where I was able to shave with no nicks or cuts.  The scent is pleasant, but I cant help feeling that I have smelled it somewhere else before.  Reminds me of a soap in the family of an Irish Spring.  That also caught me by surprise.  I expected a warm, spicy scent, but this is not.  I honestly double checked this product thinking I had been sent the after shave, but no - it's the shave cream.  This is very disappointing, and its quite possible my product is expired or just bad."

I was surprised to find a product that works like it was described. It goes on smooth; rubs it easy. The smell is faint, but manly, and not overpowering. It moisturizes my skin very nice. The razor burn/bumps are calmed down quickly. The best feature I have found...it leaves my face moisturized/soft/feeling good for many hours later. I have woken up the next morning, still feeling a soft face. That is important to me. So many products out there that seem to do nothing, soon after application.

It leaves my skin very moist. I don't even have to use moisturizer afterwards. Now the scent deserves a little more attention. Since I have been using it, everywhere I go people have been saying, ""you smell good, what is that.""  I don't wear perfume often so I assumed it was my clothes because I use those lil pellet softeners that claim freshness for days. So thats what I would tell people. Then one day, I wore an outfit that I had picked up from the  cleaners a day before. Again, many of my coworkers commented on my scent. I asked my good friend next to me what did it smell like. She said the freshes of freshness. She said that she couldn't explain it but it just smelled fresh. So then I am in the shower, my husband is shaving at the sink, and he says, ""babe I meant to tell you that I like that new soap you are using, it smells so sexy. When I am off and you are gone, the scent is still in the bed with me and it's like you are still here with me"". Awe, that's sweet right"" Anyway so it dawned on me that it was the body wash. I took it to work and ask my friend is that the scent she had been smelling and she said, ""yasssssssssssssssssssw!!!!!!!!! That's it.""  So buy it.

It removes the sensation of dry, cracked, void-of-any-and-all-moisture skin. Quickly! I had never heard of this lotion/cream before. I stumbled upon it somehow on Amazon, and I'm glad I did. I read a whole bunch of reviews (thanks reviewers), then I checked to see what EWG said as far as toxicity (they give it a 1-doesn't get any better) It was affordable too, so I gave it a try. Another benefit is that the aroma smells more like a spa than some annoying scent. I am super sensitive to fragrances. 99% of all colognes or perfumes or gag-gy lotions, make my throat feel like it's closing up. This is a minty smell that doesn't bother me, probably because it's from actual plants, not a chemical laboratory. It's a winner."

I‚Äôm always itchy whenever I forget to moisturize. I often look for lotions that are free from sulfates, parabens, and phlalates as well as cruelty free. I love that this product meets that criteria. Prior to trying this, I was using Palmers Cocoa Butter lotion, which worked well but my husband wasn‚Äôt too fond of the smell. I was intrigued by this because I love the smell of Eucalyptus and Mint together. This smells quite nice but not exactly as I imagined and doesn‚Äôt last as long as I would like. I still like it anyway. It keeps my skin moisturized for quite some time and a little goes a long way. It‚Äôs a very intense moisturizer and probably one of the draw backs is the thickness of it it‚Äôs consistency. It applies very heavy that it makes you sweat quickly and a lot from your pores not being able to breathe if you go into the heat shortly after applying. In fact it leaves your skin white like sun tan lotion until you rub it in all the way or spread to other areas. Probably the only draw back of this lotion. I will keep using it for now because it keeps my skin from drying out but I hope to find one slightly less heavy in the future."

I normally have to use about 3 pumps in my hand for my whole body, but I would imagine if you have a loofa it would only take 1-2 so that could just be on me.

Use it without a washcloth and it spreads better.  Again, does not make the shower/tub slippery.

In 2014, he had a major skin breakout that took us several doctor visits to diagnose.  Two doctors diagnosed him with eczema and referred us to a specialist.  The physicians were adamant that skin conditions are extremely hard to treat.  They wanted us to realize that this would not be easy.  The doctor gave us samples of two products.  One sample was this product and the other was Aquaphor Baby Wash & Shampoo.  We use the Eucerin in the bath water and the Aquaphor to wash our munchkin.  It worked! No pricey specialist, medications, or creams.  This did the trick and has work for years.  When the weather changes and we have more severe flair ups we use CeraVe Moisturizing Cream.  The doctor will sometimes prescribe a prescription steroid to mix with it.  These three things have been life savers for our little boy.  Skin conditions are tough to treat. Medications and treatment can be extremely expensive and often yield no benefit.  This is a review from a mom that these products work.  Yes, the Eucerin is oily.  It's an oil to moisturize the skin.  No, we have not ever had problems with it smelling, but I guess that's more of an individual biased.  That said, it doesn't have a bad smell or a great smell.  It's really plain, but if you think scented products typically cause more problems.  The bottom line it works."

A pack of 3 bottles for only slightly more than I would expect to pay for a single bottle of similar body wash. And it cleaned well. It's just soap after all. I don't know much about moisturizing or sensitive skin or anything. I just want to be clean. So basically it was all good. Except for the scent. It has a very strong antiseptic scent that lingers for a long time after the shower is over. I used it 5 or 6 times. Finally I said to my wife, ""I think I have to get a different body wash. I feel like I smell like Lysol."" Now, my wife and I, we pretty much tell each other everything. Married 20 years and that's pretty much the way we've always been. She could have said ""Oh honey you smell fine."" or even ""Why, you don't like the Nivea?"". No. She said ""Oh thank God! That stuff is atrocious!

I should have known from past experiences 3 in 1 soaps are never good, which is why it's two stars, the soap itself is a one star. I bought the nivea men's active clean with charcoal a couple times and I like it, 4.1 out of 5, great musky smell, medium thick consistency and nice lather, one major con is if I don't lotion after then my skin gets super dry, I have skin that a light consistency lotion is great, and the problem of finding a lot of lotions to heavy so I can imagine the dry skin problem being a nightmare for people who need their thick creams and lotions. With the Men's Energy 3 in 1 the dry skin problem wasn't really a problem maybe like a third of how it was/is with the Nivea Active Clean. The smell of the Energy 3 in 1 is the same not similar to but the same as the combination of the soap used to wash your car and Dove dish soap with a splash of mint that I feel was only noticeable because I smelled the Energy 3 in 1 prior to using it and as mint does made my nose hairs stand up straight but that being said the Energy 3 in 1 mint smell was very very mild and overpowerd by the scent of car wash and dish soap, gives me a headache just thinking about the smell. The consistency is light and with a transparent blue color reminds me of car soap. Lather is OK I find myself using more soap with the Energy 3 in 1 than normal because the consistency is so light, like a third more mabye. What drew me in to the Energy 3 in 1 was because when I read Energy and Mint I imagined myself after a workout or after work taking a hot shower with the smell of strong mint overpowering my senses and the mint working it's magic and relaxing and soothing my muscles, basically aromatherapy and relaxing. I got the smell of car soap with dish soap and some mint you could hardly tell was mint, a headache, 3 bottles of headache. Just what every man wants to smell like a car wash and freshly washed dishes. Used the Energy 3 in 1 as shampoo, don't even try it doesn't shampoo well at all as you can expect from any 3 in 1 bodywash product. What's the difference between the Nivea Men's Energy 3 in 1 and Nivea Men's Cool if they both contain Menthol? Anyone know? Please no replies of the Nivea Men's Cool is ICY Menthol."

It burned everywhere I had put it and once done with my shower I got out and my entire body is swollen with hives and burning. So without any doubt, this body wash is the cause.

I'm sure that there are expensive body washes that optimizes your skin condition, but those typically cost a lot more than I'd be willing to pay for. So, I hunt for cheaper products that gets the job done. I've used dove, olay, bath and body works product, body shop products, myers, etc... I really enjoyed using products from body shop because they smell amazing, but they are also not very cost-effective (small containers with a substantial price tag for a body wash). I normally don't use Dial products because they dry my skin out, but this particular body wash has just the right mix. It moisturizes, cleans, smells amazing and it is sold at a reasonable and affordable price point. If you have eczema or other skin condition, I can't say that this will be a ""cure"" for that; however, I noticed that my skin did not flare as often. I got a three month subscription because these are hard to find in stores. I used to get these from walmart, but they go out of stock from time to time and there is not much price difference even if you get it through amazon."

I suffer from mild psoriasis and these products have helped keep it at bay versus all the chemical laden skin care products that often cause more inflammation. I am so happy to be using a product that doesn't contain all the nasty stuff that I don't want to put in and on my body. They are a little more on the expensive side but they are a great value for what you're getting. Many people spend much more on high quality skin care products and I believe Tree to tub to be right up there if not higher. I love that the lather comes from the soap berry! It doesn't lather as much as you are used to with standard soaps and shampoos but it isn't laced with sulfates and other harmful chemicals. Tree to Tub has a customer for life! Now I just want them to make a hand soap for me to put at all my sinks!

Not a slippery, going to slide out of your robe moist, but just the right feeling being comfortable going to bed or to work. I was nervous about the Botanical Blossom sent it had on the label. After all, I don't want to smell like I fell in the garden or just came from Grandmas. I was pleasantly surprised by the subtle aroma and it reminded me sligly of my clothes out of the dryer.

The scent doesn't linger on for too long after showering but when I'm finally all dry it does give a much more pleasant scent thats clean and fresh.

I had a hard time finding it back in the store, so I purchased the 2 pack online.  One bottle was partially opened and has spilled a little into the box.  I only lost about an ounce so I kept it.  I finally used up my original locally bought product and went to use the Amazon purchased bottle and the body wash just came pouring out of the bottle very fast.  It was no where near as thick as the previous bottle I purchased!  Then I smelled it, it smelled HORRIBLE.  It smelled like something in it had gone bad.  After my shower I opened the 2nd bottle that came in the package and it had the same smell.  I have started the process of returning these bottles.  I am completely disappointed."

I was so disappointed by the awful, musky fragrance that I didn't even notice if it left my skin feeling any better than the last 3 other body washes I tried.  With a name like ""Rainbath"", I was expecting some heavenly, light, fragrance, but, instead, it smells like cologne from the 60's.  I truly can't understand why so many people rated this so highly, given the unpleasant fragrance AND the high cost per ounce (way more expensive than Nivea and Cetaphil's competing products, which I like better).  It smells like the tar-based dandruff shampoo they also make (T/Gel), and I've always hated the scent of that stuff.  It didn't bother my skin, but it definitely bothered my nose."

I have also used it for myself, especially after long shifts, as I work in healthcare."

There was no protective cover on the lid or around bottle to catch leaks. There were three very heavy items loose in the box with no packing material to keep them from crashing into each other as the box was moved, likely what caused the leak.

I ordered Green Tea Lemongrass scent, however, it smells like orange. Not just a hint, it's a smack you in the face with righteous indignation ORANGE! For many, this is not a big deal, may even be awesome to feel like a major league pitcher threw an orange fresh from the tree at 90 mph that slammed right between your eyes while standing in the middle of a Florida orange grove. However, I detest the fragrance (also the taste/flavor) of oranges. Needless to say when my husband was decanting it into a smaller pump dispenser for our bathroom he was shocked that I purchased something orange, his favorite. I thought I could deal since it was open, and my orange aficionado husband was happy...and again, it was already open. I was wrong. The scent is not light. However, the nausea from the fragrance has really shortened my shower time in the morning and I am also much more alert as I am trying to keep my stomach settled. I would take off 2 stars for the fragrance (I have a true disdain for oranges) but the scent doesn't linger on your skin so since it's just 3-10 minutes a day in the underworld I kick 1 star. Everything else about the body wash is great, but it's hard to appreciate it while under olfactory assault."

It does have a unique scent to it, I can see a hint of diesel type scent if you are looking for it but really I got used to the scent quickly and I actually learned to really like it.  As far as body acne it works great, I get a few pimples from working out and this stuff really breaks down the oil on your skin and cleanses better than any of the cheaper body washes I've used.  The scent doesn't hang with you either, this isn't like axe or old spice both of which I find way overpowering even hours later.  If you don't mind paying about a dollar an ounce then get this stuff.  It does also come with three caps, one with a push dispenser, a flip top cap, and the solid bottle cap it ships with.  I personally like the flip cap, you get the best control over how much you use so you don't waste any.  Also this stuff does not lather like regular body wash like suave or dove, but lather isn't as important to me as feeling clean and it does that very well!!"

So there was leakage which did not affect the rest of my order.  I will continue to use this product but will probably buy in local stores since the original packaging is no longer available on amazon

The Phisoderm is maybe a bit too watery, so it doesn't last as long as it could, but I like it better than the thick gel of the Neutrogena, because I find hard to get the Neutrogena out the bottle. I also prefer the smell to the Neutrogena, which to me smells like straight B.O. and not grapefruit like they claim!

Use it without a washcloth and it spreads better.  Again, does not make the shower/tub slippery.

In 2014, he had a major skin breakout that took us several doctor visits to diagnose.  Two doctors diagnosed him with eczema and referred us to a specialist.  The physicians were adamant that skin conditions are extremely hard to treat.  They wanted us to realize that this would not be easy.  The doctor gave us samples of two products.  One sample was this product and the other was Aquaphor Baby Wash & Shampoo.  We use the Eucerin in the bath water and the Aquaphor to wash our munchkin.  It worked! No pricey specialist, medications, or creams.  This did the trick and has work for years.  When the weather changes and we have more severe flair ups we use CeraVe Moisturizing Cream.  The doctor will sometimes prescribe a prescription steroid to mix with it.  These three things have been life savers for our little boy.  Skin conditions are tough to treat. Medications and treatment can be extremely expensive and often yield no benefit.  This is a review from a mom that these products work.  Yes, the Eucerin is oily.  It's an oil to moisturize the skin.  No, we have not ever had problems with it smelling, but I guess that's more of an individual biased.  That said, it doesn't have a bad smell or a great smell.  It's really plain, but if you think scented products typically cause more problems.  The bottom line it works."

I ordered Green Tea Lemongrass scent, however, it smells like orange. Not just a hint, it's a smack you in the face with righteous indignation ORANGE! For many, this is not a big deal, may even be awesome to feel like a major league pitcher threw an orange fresh from the tree at 90 mph that slammed right between your eyes while standing in the middle of a Florida orange grove. However, I detest the fragrance (also the taste/flavor) of oranges. Needless to say when my husband was decanting it into a smaller pump dispenser for our bathroom he was shocked that I purchased something orange, his favorite. I thought I could deal since it was open, and my orange aficionado husband was happy...and again, it was already open. I was wrong. The scent is not light. However, the nausea from the fragrance has really shortened my shower time in the morning and I am also much more alert as I am trying to keep my stomach settled. I would take off 2 stars for the fragrance (I have a true disdain for oranges) but the scent doesn't linger on your skin so since it's just 3-10 minutes a day in the underworld I kick 1 star. Everything else about the body wash is great, but it's hard to appreciate it while under olfactory assault."

The second ingredient listed is olefin sulfonate .  While it is not sodium laurel sulfate which is usually in soaps and shampoos, it is just as harsh.  This product is very hard on eyes and other sensitive areas.  I got a mild chemical burn in a very sensitive part of my body.  The smell is not anything like lemongrass.  It smells more like a combination of oranges and musk.  Not an appealing aroma at all.  This product does lather and clean well.  If it had been branded as a hand soap, I probably would have been OK with it.  But it is much too harsh for a body wash."

This stuff fits the bill in all respects. So far we have had the Citrus Blend (the pinkish colored one), Island Blend (or something like that - it's white), and now this one.

I have read a lot about the smell, which some people have described as smelling like gasoline, I don't know about that.  It does have a unique scent to it, I can see a hint of diesel type scent if you are looking for it but really I got used to the scent quickly and I actually learned to really like it.  As far as body acne it works great, I get a few pimples from working out and this stuff really breaks down the oil on your skin and cleanses better than any of the cheaper body washes I've used.  The scent doesn't hang with you either, this isn't like axe or old spice both of which I find way overpowering even hours later.  If you don't mind paying about a dollar an ounce then get this stuff.  It does also come with three caps, one with a push dispenser, a flip top cap, and the solid bottle cap it ships with.  I personally like the flip cap, you get the best control over how much you use so you don't waste any.  Also this stuff does not lather like regular body wash like suave or dove, but lather isn't as important to me as feeling clean and it does that very well!!"

Fellas, once you're done with the ""Axe""/""Old Spice"" phase and graduated to something more...adult, this is it. Women LOVE the smell... Especially when paired with the lotion... It's definitely worth the money you pay and lathers really well, so a little bit goes a long way. The smell stays pretty much all day--although that could be the lotion. I got them gifted to me as a set and never had one without the other. I usually take the wife to bath & body works and just pass right by it...because let's face it. We think it's a women's store making a half hearted attempt at shaking husbands and boyfriends down for money... Wife won't let them leave so they might as well sniff the guys section, one by one until it hurts or it's time to go....but I'm glad I got this as a gift. It's by far the best body wash out there... Yeah you pay a little more, but quality is quality... BBW got it right."

It's effective at reducing back acne and helps to smooth out my KP. The smell is fresh and not overwhelming. The Phisoderm is maybe a bit too watery, so it doesn't last as long as it could, but I like it better than the thick gel of the Neutrogena, because I find hard to get the Neutrogena out the bottle. I also prefer the smell to the Neutrogena, which to me smells like straight B.O. and not grapefruit like they claim!

After using this I felt cleaner than I ever had before with any other body wash or soap, and with having small grandbabies that like to play in the dirt, I like that it's also fights fungus and bacteria. My husband had just gotten into some poison ivy and although it didn't make it magically disappear he says it has helped a lot with itching and drying it out. I am not a big fan of the price (I'm cheap lol) but it's worth it!"

I have read a lot about the smell, which some people have described as smelling like gasoline, I don't know about that.  It does have a unique scent to it, I can see a hint of diesel type scent if you are looking for it but really I got used to the scent quickly and I actually learned to really like it.  As far as body acne it works great, I get a few pimples from working out and this stuff really breaks down the oil on your skin and cleanses better than any of the cheaper body washes I've used.  The scent doesn't hang with you either, this isn't like axe or old spice both of which I find way overpowering even hours later.  If you don't mind paying about a dollar an ounce then get this stuff.  It does also come with three caps, one with a push dispenser, a flip top cap, and the solid bottle cap it ships with.  I personally like the flip cap, you get the best control over how much you use so you don't waste any.  Also this stuff does not lather like regular body wash like suave or dove, but lather isn't as important to me as feeling clean and it does that very well!!"

It smells soooooo good that you can just lather with it forever and a day. I am so glad that I gave it a try and I have no regrets about it. This is so moisturizing and refreshing. The scent is truly amazing (to me). I have been using Olay for over 20 yrs and have never regretted it. It is a wonderful brand. I just wish that they would make a lotion to compliment their body washes. That would be so great...

On the whole it‚Äôs pretty  underwhelming. Straight off it doesn‚Äôt lather that well and I used up a lot more than I usually do with Dial. It has a subtle soapy smell that doesn‚Äôt hang around much after drying off if that‚Äôs important, but at the same time don‚Äôt expect to get any compliments with a fresh out of the shower smell, there‚Äôs also no moisturiser if that‚Äôs another issue.

The only thing with the body wash is that you have to use a generous amount to get a rich lather, but other than that.... superb! I love the way this Jasmine and coconut oil one smells. I knew it would smell good just by the name of it! I started out using the lavender one which smells really good, but after a while, I wanted to feel more luxurious when I bathed. So I switched to the vanilla and she‚Äôs moisture. And with this Jasmine one, I wanted to bring out my feminine energy and she really loves jasmine and rose petals, for some reason. The coconut oil is a great moisturizer too! I mix Hollywood tea tree oil in my lather. My skin is so soft and smooth."

I've given the product a good try hoping I'd get used to it, but I'm finally ready to say that's not going to happen; the smell is intolerable.  The claim of rosemary (one of my favorite smells) and mint baffles me.  I'm not sure how to describe it, but neither of those scents comes to mind.  (Nothing related to the sea either.  Nothing like anything I've ever smelled.)  The scent is the most off putting, but I don't care for the lathering either.  There's not much of it.  As for it's impact on my skin - I feel like I want to itch after using, but a medication I take has just barely stopped an allergic reaction.  I waited too long to return the bottle, unfortunately, but I won't use it again.  I wish I'd listened to the warnings here.  Gleck!"

It might smell more ""manly"" to some, but I genuinely enjoy the scent; that being said, it is something my husband and I can both use. It lathers well, and I do not feel dried out after showering, and it helped my skin problem that was happening with my old sulfate filled body wash. Do I wish it was a bit cheaper? Sure.

In fact the soap is nice on the skin, it is only the scent that is IMHO terrible. To me this smells like when grandma loses her senses and uses wayyy too much of that cheap perfume. When my wife showered with it I could smell it halfway across the house. I tried it myself and I can still smell it, hours later. The smell is not really to my tastes, since I don't want to smell like grandma. It's sort of like a light perfume meets baby powder scent. I usually use unscented soaps and detergents, but have found ""Oat"" type products to have very limited scent. Unfortunately this is not the case, and I ordered the 3-pack. I don't believe I can return this stuff now that I started using one bottle. I am a 50-something male. You have been warned."

However, this time I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging. This is the first time I've ordered where the product was not leaking all over the place! In the past, I wrapped one as a gift inside the package Amazon shipped it in. As we were driving, I'm all, ""Why do I smell Satsuma?"" We get to Christmas, and it's gift time. My best friend peels the wrapping paper back only to be bombarded by Satsuma fragrance. She says excitedly while opening,""Well, I certainly know what this is-EEEWWWW it's EVERYWHERE!"" I peer inside the box, and the plastic inside is soaked with soapy shower gel that is dripping everywhere. She throws the box away, washes the gel off the bottle and her hands in the kitchen sink, and promptly brings it to her shower so it doesn't leak anywhere else. It was slippery, so she nearly dropped it on her foot, and it's very heavy. Ouch! How embarrassing! When it's for me, it's no big deal. But as a gift, I expect it to be perfect. So this time, I ordered from a different seller. Not only is the bottle design different, the gel lathers well and smells better than any other Satsuma shower gel I've gotten on Amazon. Now, my husband is using it. He opened the bathroom door yesterday, and I asked if he was enjoying my new body wash as much as I was. His face reddened, and he didn't answer as he scurried off.

I tried every medicine, every cream, every diet you could think of to clear this up and recently candida kicked in and I was at my lowest. The two together was taking every bit of energy my body had until I discovered this. Purely by accident by the way. Now I do not know if this was the only thing that knocked it out or if it was due to the host of other natural remedies I was trying as well but I can say.... THIS WAS THE ONLY THING THAT TAMED THE INFLAMMATION AND IRRITATION. After two weeks of combating candida and four years of bacteria, even after I got rid of the issue, the irritation was still there. Now as I stated before I don't know if this did it alone but I also was taking epsom salt soaks with 100% organic lavender and bathing with ""REMEDY SOAP"", applying coconut oil mixed 100% organic tea tree oil to the affected area, taking candida complex, garlique, vitamin c, and acidophilus as well as drinking a host of water and modifying my diet to reduce ""not eliminate"" carbs, starches, and sugars. I know it sounds like a lot but it really wasn't in comparison to suffering for four years. ALL in ALL I went to the doctor to be sure the candida was gone and found out the bacteria was gone as well. So I got a 2 for 1. I continue to bath with ""REMEDY SOAP"" and take Candida Complex and garlique for safe measures but I AM A BELIEVER!!!! TRY IT AND YOU WONT TURN BACK....."

While they aren't 100% completely organic and/or natural ingredients, PiperWai does try to use as high a quantity of natural ingredients as they can. For anyone with sensitive skin or trouble with skincare products loaded with additives and preservatives, this brand is a good choice. The unscented body wash is preferable for anyone that doesn't like pefumey products or is bothered by heavy scents. It has a mild 'soapy' scent, but nothing that lingers on skin or that will make your shower seem like you are breathing in nothing but fragrance vapors. You can also add a little of your favorite essential oil scent (or even favorite eau de toilette or eau de parfum) to create a custom scented body wash. The ginger chamomile body wash has a pleasant though quite light scent of fresh ginger. It's a refreshing way to start your morning off, but the scent doesn't last once you are done bathing."

Been using it for more than 5 years now. A little goes a long way and it makes my skin feel great. My only complaint is the recent packaging change. Why oh why did they have to change the bottle?!?! The old style bottle was easy to grab & hold in the shower due to the matte finish and the flip top stayed closed but was easy to open. This new style bottle is slippery. The first one I used slipped out of my hand, fell to the floor & broke the cap. And the new cap sucks because after a few times of opening & closing the hinge breaks. So this packaging change was probably a decision made in their corporate boardroom to save a few cents but it's stupid."

This body wash has many cons,  and only a few pros. First,  the scent.  I like the scent.  It's not overpowering. Other than that,  everything else is not so great.  No matter how hard I try,  I cannot get Ballwash to come out from the bottle or the pump. It's too rich and way too thick.  It's really annoying.  In addition to that,  it's also a little bit drying; too drying for everyday use.  I also don't think this works any better for your below bits than any other wash. It's all just a marketing ploy. This wouldn't work more than any other shower gel for your crotch. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone; it's impossible to dispense, it's drying, and way overpriced.  The only thing I like is the scent. The customer service at Ballsy is also poor. I've bought from them directly and their customer service is now based in the Philippines. :("

The product is intimidating at first because of the charcoal.  It comes out in your hand pure black but it quickly lathers right up as good as your soap, has a nice light scent, and washes off as easily.  It turns a grey color in your hand and turns the water on your shower floor grey just long enough to wash down the drain.  That's to say, it does not stain your shower or your skin.  And it really keeps me clean all day and into the evening hours.  No more sweaty smell.  No kidding.  I had intended to use it a few times a week or maybe every other day but have found I like it so much that I use it daily.  I will definitely be ordering more and using this product for now on."

Everything that goes into this product, all EO products, seems to be based upon quality, high standards.

Unfortunately my local store of choice stopped selling this particular Dial scent. So I have turned to Amazon. I ordered 2 bottles. Thank goodness they were well packaged and wrapped individually in plastic because one had leaked a little bit. The other was perfect.  Years ago it was antibacterial as most Dial body washes were, but that is no longer the case. Again, for those of you in the back, it does not contain any antibacterial ingredients stop freaking asking. It's now a basic body wash plain and simple. It does no miraculous things to your skin. If you aren't an occasional lotion user, it will probably dry your skin, as all body washes will eventually.  Use lotion you lazy animal. The smell is not a strong herbal scent and does not stick with you all day long. If you want to smell like you rolled in the lavender then sprinted through the jasmine during a twilight moon for the next 2 weeks, be prepared to be disappointed. It is a light fresh pleasant floral scent. I love the scent at 37 years old and so does my 3 girls ages 4, 11, 19. My husband who is very scent sensitive, prefers me to use this body wash as it does not make him sneeze or whine like a baby about his precious sensitivities. According to one reviewer you have to be a 12 year old to like it. Guess I'm young at heart. It cost less than your monthly streaming service, just try one single bottle before purchasing a whole case. If you don't like it, don't buy it again. See how easy that was. Now go forth and wash yo booty."

The amount is more than most body wash containers and the price was affordable. The liquid is pretty thick, smells nice and cleans and refreshes my skin like any other body wash. As for it spilling out quickly (as some other reviewers have wrote about), I didn't really have a problem with that. I have bought this specific size/brand before at grocery/pharmacy stores and thought those spilled out quickly as well. So I didn't really notice a difference. I think the quick spilling at first has more to do with the weight and amount of liquid in the container, rather than it being diluted. As I continued to use the body was and the amount lessened the liquid spills out much slower. The ones that I bought (shipped and sold from Amazon) works just like any other body wash. I also love getting it shipped to my house so I don't have to make a trip to the grocery store just for body wash. I will buy this again when I run out, and may even try different scents/formulas."

It has a great combination and is more light and gentle on my skin. My husband usually likes a particular brand as well but he loves it too so it is a nice money saver. The scent is light and doesn't overwhelm the entire bathroom for the entire day. There isn't any residue on the skin just a nice balance leaning my skin softer instead of a thick feeling. I absolutely would reccomend it , particularly if you have sensitive or a combination of dry/oily skin. I may have to leave my old brand behind! I just hope the price stays the same :)"

But I really wanted to give this a try because of the cannabis sativa seed oil. Like everyone is saying, it doesn't have a good lather. You're not going to get lots of bubbles. But a lot of bubbles/a good lather doesn't always mean a good clean. My skin felt perfectly clean. I do think it made my skin more soft! I, personally, liked the smell (even though I normally prefer girly, floral scents). It's definitely a unisex body wash. It's not masculine but not feminine. So, ladies, if you're wanting something floral-y, this is not it.  Did it make me de-stress? I really want to say yes but I'm not sure. Maybe after a few uses I'll be able to tell (and I will update then). I know a few people complained about the packaging/leaking... Mine was packaged well with no leaking.

I bought it thinking it would be a sweet vanilla scent, but that is not at all the case. I wouldn't even say it smells anything like vanilla if I just smelled the soap without knowing its name. It is actually more powdery smelling than sweet or woodsy. Not always a bad thing, but in this case, it definitely has a big time ""old lady"" scent (excuse the terminology) which I'm sure a lot of people find pleasant! It just didn't meet my expectations. Besides all that, it's a great wash. It's thick, creamy, lathers well and definitely softens my skin even if I forget lotion. Not a bad product, just a tad underwhelming."

It's a strong smell, probably stronger than the other scent I've tried (botanical blossom), but I like going to bed and still smelling it on my body. It seems like it's a little more moisturizing than the botanical blossom kind too. Nivea is my favorite body wash brand and the only kind that doesn't leave my skin feeling tight after using it.

Weirdly, it has only been at certain times of my life - not consistently.  Nonetheless, I have had patches of eczema on my hands for about 5 years and I can't find a product that makes it better, including prescribed creams.  I like the idea of a ph balanced soap so that I don't keep stripping my skin dry, so I decided to try this product.  It smells great, gives you a clean feeling and a little goes a long way.  However, it didn't necessarily help my eczema.  I think if I made sure to moisturize ALL the time, that would help but honestly, I don't think to do it after I wash my hands.  It's like cutting up vegetables for a salad or something, it just feels like a lot of work.  (Yes, I am acutely aware that I would have died on the first day as a pioneer, ""Skin this rabbit for dinner?  Uhhh, no thank you."")  But I digress, the point is that I really do like the soap and I like supporting organic/non-GMO/fair trade/natural products and their companies so I gave it 4 stars; 5 if it had cleared up my skin.  Of note, perhaps if the eczema was on a part of my body that isn't washed 13 times per day, I might have had a better outcome."

I was skeptical at first but I am desperate for any relief with my recent flare. I used a generous amount on my affected areas, I did not let the product sit there I rinsed it off pretty quick.

It didn‚Äôt really improve the scaling of the skin but it improved the texture and the redness and irritation.

So my skin tends to dry out more. I followed the directions and used slightly Luke warm water on my body. I rubbed on the effected areas and brushed the skin softly. I left it on for five minutes. There were no scales on my skin. I usually have to scrub and bleed to get it off. There was no burn. I use this in conjunction with CeraVe psoriasis moisturizing cream after I shower. It is not a cure but believe me when I say it has helped immensely. The skin color is not red but lighter. I don‚Äôt itch. I sometimes get depress over my skin and dread the shower because i have to brush my skin and look at it. This has softened  blow immensely. I have also stopped taking steroid creams because they no longer work. I am exercising regularly and taking a probiotic. I have been noticing some serious improvements. I love this product.

I was hopeful that fragrance free and for sensitive skin meant it would help with issues I‚Äôve had before however it seems to have caused contact dermatitis for me. After developing rashes I looked at the ingredients. It contains sodium laureth sulfate which is a known skin irritant (it‚Äôs used to make the soap foam up but it strips the skin of its natural oils). I would recommend avoiding this if you have sensitive skin. Plus the scent that it contains is actually quite pungent. More fragrant than soaps that don‚Äôt claim to be fragrance free.

I have sensitive skin and am prone to psoriasis outbreaks. I have tried Many different soaps, body washes, even making my own and purchasing from other makers of natural goat milk soaps. The only ones that do not bother me are completely natural or some very simply baby washes. I find I don't always have the time to make my own and purchasing all natural can get pricey and sometimes honestly they can smell badly fairly quickly. This particular dove wash with the cucumber and green tea does not aggravate my skin the way many soaps can and even seems to sooth the psoriasis a little.

I usually buy it at Walmart but they‚Äôve been out of stock lately so I turned to amazon, I also decided to try some of their lotion and face wash, both of which really like as well, but the face wash was a different scent than was advertised ( described as coconut and neem, arrived as papaya and neem) I was pretty disappointed because I really like coconut but my skin seems to like the soap and the smell is refreshing and spa-like. Unfortunately two of the three bottles arrived with broken pumps. All three bottles were just thrown in a box with absolutely no packaging so zero stars on the packaging. 3 stars on description accuracy, 5 starts on scent amount and quality of the products themselves."

The first ingredient is NEEM which for avid planthusiasts, is a necessity for fighting off pests that arise. The fact is also, neem oil is best used when you mix it with some sort of soap to help it bind together to spray on your leaves. I was desperate one day to clean my dusty leaves and figured that this organic formula is actually PERFECT as long as you dilute the soap with lots of water. I used one tiny pump with lots water and mixed it in a spray bottle onto a microfiber cloth. This concoction worked BEAUTIFULLY for getting the job done and I haven‚Äôt gotten any pests since then. My leaves are so shiny and beautiful and since taking off that layer of dust on them, they have been growing faster as there‚Äôs nothing impeding them from  receiving ample light. I do believe the original version is best for this HACK since we don‚Äôt know how the essential oils on the other options are going to react to your plants. As far as a body cleanser, it is nice however I still prefer something with SLS from time to time to get rid of grime and a little funk from the underarms. I usually have something strictly for those CREVASSES (play on words thanks to Tenacious D, IYKYK). Hope this helps y‚Äôall!"

Although I am not currently pregnant, I still try to stick to the items I was using when pregnant, avoiding certain chemicals and harsher ingredients. My period is back and every once in a while I get hormonal breakouts. I'm glad I found this because this is exactly what I was looking for! I've actually never tried Honest skincare products aside from their baby products like diapers so I was intrigued. I am only using this as a face wash because I have no breakouts on my body. I found it easy to spread and lather on my face because of its gel like consistency, and it was easily rinsed off. It didn't dry out my face and I didn't experience any irritation after use. It is too soon to tell if it will help with my hormonal breakouts but my skin usually clears itself up after a few days anyway - but I just like that there are ingredients in this that will help me ""glow"". While I personally would have liked for this one to have a light fragrance, I understand fragrance free is probably very important for any pregnant moms, so I can't complain. I didn't like the fragrance free smell of this product (that no scent, scent - if that makes any sense!) but it is bearable. This is quite a large tube and since I am using it only as a face wash and not body wash, it will last me quite a while. I recommend any pregnant mamas to look into this cleanser if you want a gentle glow."

I love how it is both a face and body wash and it works well on both. For my body, I put a small amount of a loofah and it lathered up well and made my skin feel pretty soft. For my face I just took a small amount in my hands and rubbed it all over for a minute and then rinsed. So far I haven't noticed any drastic changes to my breakouts, but they definitely aren't any worse and I think with time I will hopefully notice some improvements. I really like that this is a product designed specifically for pregnant women because when I was pregnant, I felt as though every product was off limits to me, or had a warning about checking with your doctor before using. I am sure pregnant women appreciate having something made with their skin specifically in mind. The only thing that I dislike is the scent. Even though it is labeled as unscented, it still has this underlying fragrance that I do not love and I would honestly prefer a fragrance to this unscented scent. Overall, this is great for any pregnant or not pregnant ladies with breakouts who want a product made from natural ingredients."

While they aren't 100% completely organic and/or natural ingredients, PiperWai does try to use as high a quantity of natural ingredients as they can. For anyone with sensitive skin or trouble with skincare products loaded with additives and preservatives, this brand is a good choice. The unscented body wash is preferable for anyone that doesn't like pefumey products or is bothered by heavy scents. It has a mild 'soapy' scent, but nothing that lingers on skin or that will make your shower seem like you are breathing in nothing but fragrance vapors. You can also add a little of your favorite essential oil scent (or even favorite eau de toilette or eau de parfum) to create a custom scented body wash. The ginger chamomile body wash has a pleasant though quite light scent of fresh ginger. It's a refreshing way to start your morning off, but the scent doesn't last once you are done bathing."

I tried a more expensive lip color with the same procedure (you put on the color, let dry, then add the lip gloss). But the expensive one I tried was not any better than Covergirl. I cannot use a regular lip stick because it just will not stay on at all. Outlast will last a long time, but of course it will fade when you eat or drink often."

Ive owned it before and loved the moisturizing aspect. However, what was delivered to me was not an authentic product. A)The tube is different. The real CoverGirl product has a shorter top and longer tube. This one has a much longer too, leading me first to realize there is probably less product. B)the packaging doesnt match. The CoverGirl logo is in the right font, and the strip is black, not silver, like every other CG product ever. C) the product itself was clearer than the one i used to own, meaning theres less lotion, and more petroleum jelly."

Covergirl Outlast lipcolors have solved this problem for me! Lipcolor evens out my lip color and lasts for a good 8-10 hrs only fading slightly (yet evenly) as the day wears on. The colors are good neutral shades, as well... I have at least 5 shades that are good on me depending on the look I want. I usually line outside with a slightly darker color for defined look and then immediately swipe a coordinating paler color on central lip, blending with my finger before it sets. This seems to give my lip color a more natural look. Love this lipcolor!"

I've never really worn lipstick before so I wanted a sort of starter set to figure out what I like and how to use them. These lipsticks are great for that. The colors are bright and the formulas are mostly very creamy. The packaging is beautiful and compact and they actually last quite a while at least in my experience. They do transfer quite a bit but once they've completely dried down they don't transfer as much unless you really rub them. Even when they do transfer, the look of the lips is still pretty neat and bright. I usually only have to reapply once or twice in a day and even then it's not because they look bad it's just because I happened to be near a mirror and figured I would just because. In the two pictures of my face I'm wearing Orchid which is by far my favorite and it's very creamy and long lasting. There are some shades that I dont like but that all just comes down to them being too bright and my own personal preference being more neutral, brownish tones. Another downside is that they do make my lips feel pretty dry throughout the day, but I dont notice it most of the time and I think it's worth it because I feel good that I look good."

It's very matte, so I like to wear a swoosh of something else over top, Burt's Bee's or something clear with a bit of shine, but it's really such a pretty color I don't need to do any layering with other colors. It does need to be re-applied a couple of times a day, but I am good with that.  I am throwing out a ton of lipsticks that just didn't work for me and sticking with this. It's quite lovely!"

First time trying a NARS product of any kind for me, so I don't know about the longevity of the lipstick in the tube, if it will dry out. But as a blue-eyed, fair-skinned blonde, this is a great color. I wanted something bold for dinner, christmas parties, and to give me a little pick me up on dreary days at work - but not a bright fire engine red. This has a hint of blue undertone to it, it's not orangey at all. I will say this isn't the smoothest lipstick to apply - your lips need some moisture on them to start with as the lipstick kind of pulls at my lips when I swipe it on without a little moisturizer underneath. But I am in love with this color."

Its not so pale that its nude, its a perfect pale pink, not white like some reviews, but if you have darker skin, it may be too pale for you.  This is perfect for pale skin blondes and light brunettes.  A little translucent, so its not a full coverage lipstick, perfect everyday lipstick, nice and creamy, not sticky, easy to forget I'm wearing it.  I will be ordering more!"

I have an oily face and so by the end of a hot day my other matte lipsticks will start to get wet around my lip line and start to disperse, but this stayed on all day and my lip line still looks perfect. I am super impressed by these and can‚Äôt wait to try them all out!"

Even if you try on lipsticks at expensive department stores, you still have to go outdoors to see what it looks like cause the lighting is oddly terrible. I used to only buy expensive cosmetics and life changed. Oh well, I'm figuring it out.  So so difficult to pick lipsticks. I had tried this brand before from a hand me down and I used the whole tube. That means I liked it. So when searching for a pretty corally pink lipstick, I thought, hey, I'll look on Amazon for one in this brand. I found awesome reviews like crazy on this Tropical Coral and the price was great so what the heck. I didn't really have high hopes cause even the computers don't show all the colors accurately. OMG!  I looooove this lipstick. I haven't felt so pretty in years. I must admit, that the name scared me cause I was thinking Old Lady coral...LOL!  Nope!!  Just Right!!!

The lipstick itself has a nice buttery feel when applied but there is simply not enough pigment in these lipsticks to make them look on the lips the same color as they appear in the tube. Even a straightforward classic red only registers light pink on the lips and when tested on my hand. Some barely register a color. Probably better to spend money on a single tube of lipstick you know you love rather than buy a set of 12 that are just so-so and indistinct. That said, if you like very sheer lipsticks you may like this, but just know that rather than 12 distinct shades, its more like 4-5 shades with very incremental differences between them."

Occasional application is needed, but not any more frequent than any other drugstore lipstick. The only things I don't like about these lipsticks are the packaging and the transfer.

It's more sheer than blush ripple & perfect for a natural everyday makeup look. Like it's obvious I am wearing something but it's not in your face, look at me and not at my makeup kind of way.

I LOVE IT. I put it on on the morning and if I don't take it off before I go to bed, which I always do, it will still be there in the morning. I use the Maybelline SuperStay eraser (basically chapstick) and then I follow it up with the Lanc√¥me Eye Makeup Remover to get the rest because it stays on so well (I know it says it's for eyes but it takes this waterproof lipstick off perfectly). I couldn't stop buying these colors! I'm a brown/caramel complexion and I think I bought every shade to compliment my skin tone. My favorites are 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40...I guess that sequence might be a coincidence! I wear 20 (Pioneer) and 40 (Believer) the most. The colors I received do look slightly different on the brown skinned swatch, and some colors look better on a full face (makeup). I also had Huntress (Not pictured here) but I gave it to my BFF because she does a full face and it looked amazing on her, she's maybe a half shade darker than me but she has the face for it, it just didn't go with my faux 'stache (it's really just a shadow on my upper lip, I refuse to wax or shave and make it noticeable to the world). Some of the shades I still have would go better with makeup, and maybe they would be better with liner, but it's not the kind of lipstick to use when practicing because once it's on, it's on! One of my colors came in and I think something was wrong with the one I got because it goes on gritty. But all the others are smooth and I don't have to ever reapply, I would actually advise against reapplication. Better to remove it and start over, or hurry up and take it off before it dries, about 3 minutes. I am sure I'll end of buying more, and perhaps rebuy the one that came in bad to see if it does anything for me when it can apply right lol."

It is def matte so if you don't like that this is not for you. It wears very well (being a matte) and I don't have to apply lipstick for hours even after drinking and light eating. It's not 'masky' like some ultra mattes, but is definitely a thicker lipstick, not a sheer. You can apply a lighter toned gloss in the center if you don't like the feel of it. If you are a brunette with dark eyes and a darker skin tone, this is a great natural looking mauve with a subtle pop of color. Love it."

        ",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I got this Omaniac Lip Gloss 5 Pcs Set as a gift for my wife. The colors are bold and sassy, definitely not for the timid. The box is black with shiny green print and green trimwork. It looks pretty cool. The inner plastic tray has five form fitting slots for each of the lip gloss colors, which also looks pretty cool. Each container of lip gloss is shaped like a tall rectangular pillar, clear at the bottom with a solid black screw off top. It's all plastic, but the clear part looks like frosted glass, and looks very expensive. The Omaniac logo is in shiny green on the top of the black cap. The overall effect is of a very high end, elegant item. Each lip gloss goes on wet and shiny and keeps much of its bright color as it dries. This set of five containers of lip gloss is a good value at the current listing price of $24.99, and my wife and I both consider it very giftable."

        ",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"These are definitely a matte liquid lipstick and not a lip gloss. Sellers need to stop saying that because matte is literally the opposite of glossy  -- they can't be both. You get five different colors in the set so it's not bad at $5 each but they are about half the size of regular lipstick tubes. They come with a nice applicator and the color goes on smooth -- it's easy to get a solid color and it doesn't look splotchy. I was hoping some of the colors would have more pink in them but all of these colors are very warm and have an orange base to them so be aware of that. Even though the one in my photo looks more like a dark mauve, it was a lot warmer once I put it on. These are fairly long lasting and they don't flake off or dry out your lips."

        ",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"This matte lipstick set has a good variety of colors. The lipstick liquid is thin and watery.  The problem is that this causes it to bleed and smear more easily.  So you end up with less definition with application and this makes it more difficult to apply cleanly.  All the colors are much more intense than they would they would seem to be in their bottles.  However, because they are matte, they are very drying to your lips.  A suggestion would be using a moisturizer before applying.  The lipstick does last for three to four hours. However, I have noticed using oils like jojoba over it can help remove it easily from your lips."

I've been trying out so many of them since wearing a mask.  Most of them are awful-very drying and/or cakey, wear off too soon, all sort of problems.  This one is very nice.  I don't find it too drying, I won't go as far as to say that is not drying at all, it is slightly so, but not bad.  It wears very, very well, and I don't get a lot of caking on the inner lip with it.  It wears a long time, and I get very little to none wearing off on my mask.  I bought 006, Eyes on You, which is a nice medium neutral brown-but-not-too-brown, it has enough of a pink or some undertone to it to keep it from being brown.  And I have 009, Speak Up, which is a medium neutral pinky mauve, not Barbie or bubblegum pink by any means, just a neutral pink leaning warmer.  Both are very easy to wear shades that could be called Neutral shades to wear easily with most things.  I am sold on this formula, they did well with this."

I 'bleeds' and the color becomes like an orange/redish type of distasteful stuff.

To be honest, I dind't know that and I was going to trash it out.

It literally feels like tinted lip gloss and the gloss in the lip stick is was over powering. It's almost to greasy. The only thing I can say is that the color was spot on just not dark enough to stay on the lips.

Beautifully opaque, richly pigmented, it glides on like a satin formula but it dries down to a lovely velvet finish. The color More Scarlet is a gorgeous warm toned true red. Like any bullet style lipstick it does have some transfer, but the transfer is minimal. It also doesn‚Äôt feather or bleed. The slim style helps with the precision of the application. But I would still recommend using a lip liner for a more precise outline if you overline your lips. It wears comfortably, I didn‚Äôt notice any drying sensation on the lips. I wish that the shade range was bigger, but hopefully that will come in time. All in all, this lipstick works just as well as several of my high end lipsticks (Pat McGrath, Fenty).

I waited and waited for this to dry down and it never did. At least 10 to 15 minutes. I sat there with my mouth gaping open and every time I touched my lips together little pieces would start to gather together on my lips.

I think compares to expensive brands. Very moisturizing. Not highly pigmented. But it makes your natural lip color look good.  You just have to find your shade. Don't be afraid when it arrives if color doesn't look like you expected. Try it on, shades seem to work with any coloring. If your lips are on the dry side put on blistex deep renewal protectant  first. Then apply your lip stick. Dry lips take color differently. I sometimes layer these to get my perfect shade. Great price people with exceptional results.  I am blonde, blue eyes, med skin color ( with red undertones in it) my lips are darker shade than I like (I like a nude lip)so I tone them down with these shades. I have many colors.

The colors are good neutral shades, as well... I have at least 5 shades that are good on me depending on the look I want. I usually line outside with a slightly darker color for defined look and then immediately swipe a coordinating paler color on central lip, blending with my finger before it sets.

It's cost effective too in that sense and I think it's already reasonably¬†priced.i will definitely buy other shades tooLip Glossy has¬†a little shine as its name applies to natural shine and that's what I wanted. it's not overly glossed or sticky.

I was looking for something that was essentially waterproof. This lip color is good at keeping the color throughout 2 hour sessions in the pool, steam room, and jacuzzi. There are two components: the lip stain and the gloss overcoat. The lip stain stays on like a boss. The gloss part needs reapplication after swimming ( big deal). All on all, I recommend this product. The price was reasonable too."

First I bought a few from Loreal Riche color shine line and I fell in love so I wanted something along the lines of that without the hi shine finish so i can switch it up a bit throughout summer.  This lipstick is my answer.  I love the formula...feels soft and comfortable...not dry.  I ordered 2 colors to start and this is the 1st I received.  The pictures are definitely deceiving add to the color.  And being fair skinned, Iv have to be careful because it doesn't take much for a shade to look to dark out bright on me. When I opened this, I was convinced it was going to be way to dark but when I applied it, I was pleased to see that it's not as opaque as I thought and i was able to sheet it or across my lips and the end result was very flattering.  With a pop of gloss in the center...I was left wondering why it had taken me so long to discover such a pretty, comfortable lipstick.  People complain about having to reapply but you should know before you purchase a creamy lipsticklike this that it is an inevitable part of wearing t his kind if formula.  I don't mind doing it...it takes 2 seconds and my lips always look freshly applied.  Well be buying more shades"

Schrecker,,Verified Purchase,,"I saw this product used on Emma Stone at the Oscars and thought she looked wonderful.  I'm no Emma Stone, but I've needed an ""orange"" type lipstick for certain outfits that isn't too yellow  (I look better in cooler tones).  This is more of a coral while still having an orange tint--it is exactly what I was looking for color-wise.  I especially love the texture and low-shine of this lipstick.  There is still a little shine, but I'd call it more of a satin.  Less shine looks better on women my age (early 50's).  I would suggest going to Revlon's site to review the colors if you don't know what color to purchase, or check it out at a store if you have any questions about color.  I'm very happy with the quality and color of this lipstick.  As far as the cost--I probably could have found this much cheaper in a local store, but I'm disabled and have a hard time getting out, so I was willing to pay a bit more for the convenience of delivery.  I do think this lipstick is as high in quality as some designer/department store brands.  Well done, Revlon."

It is one of my very favorite colors.  It doesn't last all that long on me because I drink lots of water and spread my meals out in the day (so I don't eat three meals but four or five very small meals) so it is understandable why I would need to apply it frequently.  I have yet to find a lipstick that has the right balance of pigment and moisture.  This line also has a very faint fruity taste and fragrance (not floral or perfumey, yay!) and it stays put when applied.  I use a basic inexpensive lip liner.  The color is bold but the photo used in the advertisement is not accurate.  The actual item is a deep pink color which in this case, matches the photo but I'm not sure what it looks like on your computer screen."

I usually always do, but I saw this for half off on Prime Day, got too excited and just purchased without doing any research. When I got it in the mail I was excited, the packaging was nice and there were no broken shadows or anything. But as soon as I put my finger in the first shadow to swatch them, I could immediately tell they weren‚Äôt real high-end eyeshadows. I swatched all the shades and they were a bit powdery but most still had decent pigment so I decided to give it a shot on the eyes. I‚Äôve used it twice now and as soon as I started blending the first shadow on my lid, I could tell it was fake. The shadows are powdery, don‚Äôt blend well and there‚Äôs a TON of fallout. These are hands down NOT high end eyeshadows. I tapped my brush into the shadows lightly just one time and it was like a dust storm of eyeshadow everywhere. Is it usable? Yes. But nowhere near worth $40 or even the $22 that I paid when it was on sale. Spend your money elsewhere!"

I just hit fifty and I find my lips are not as full as they once were and lipsticks seem to turn orange on me. Of course while I was waiting for their delivery yesterday I started reading the reviews‚Ä¶ eeek what did I just purchase I thought. This morning I am trying them and they really are lovely. I can‚Äôt speak to the 24hr last but I can to a few other things. I think the colors were spot on to the pictures. Even from the pics I knew the colors I would like immediately. I was gentle in opening them thinking they might break but like most lipsticks don‚Äôt roll it up too much. A little primer or something might work to help with the glide as there was a small amount of resistance. As far as staying power as I said I can‚Äôt speak to the 24 hr stay or smudging but when I tried removing it it took a number of tries even with coconut oil. I would say overall a good purchase.

I like it because it is creamy and goes on easily and has no scent.  I thought this was very reasonablly priced on Amazon.  I gave it four out of five starts only because it is not long lasting and needs to be reapplied frequently if you are eating or drinking.  Highly Recommend!!"

I got this on a whim as I was tired of the matte look and how it dried out my lips, or the super moisturizing lipsticks that smeared and came off on anything. So I got this and I am hooked as are my two daughters, this lipstick feels like a super rich chapstick, it goes on softly, delicately adds color to your lips and brightens the smile as well. I now have to hide my Lip Stick Queen, when it arrives or my daughters will quickly swipe it.  I recommend this to anyone and everyone who wants a natural looking lip color.  Its phenomenal, I have decided to try the other colors as well since this one has been so amazing. I recommend you to do!"

I usually line outside with a slightly darker color for defined look and then immediately swipe a coordinating paler color on central lip, blending with my finger before it sets.

The first time I ordered it atleast only half the lipstick was off the base...but as I tried using it the 2nd time.. it came off completely. I have attached photos of both colors. The can't stop color was only used 2x and looks like I used it a ton. Hahaha. I will be giving this one to my little one to play with since I don't want to apply this with a brush or qtip. It is a shame that they arrived broken both times especially since the colors are beautiful.

Flirty is a beautiful, saturated deep red, but applies unevenly, thinly and acts like a spotlight on any dry area. I wear many lip products in this shade range and this is my first true dud of the group. Several coats achieves something almost wearable, but it honestly looks like you have darker-than-the-shade confetti stuck to your lips. Generally, this formula is opaque and moisturizing, but this is about the worst you could do for a lipstick honestly. I recommend just about any other brand/formula for this color family."

If you've ever used NYX lingerie liquid lipstick, these are the dupes in color and tubes/applicator, but these might even be better(and I love NYX lipsticks) They smell so good, like a subtle chocolate cake batter.

Also great for first timers to try before they invest in any expensive ones. One or two of the colors need two coats but at a freakin dollar per tube it's a total steal. I can still over line my lips with these and line it up with concealer to make the lip stick look sharp and my lips look full. Best bang for your buck for sure!

Some of the shades are far from nude, two are almost neon even.They have this artificial vanilla smell about them. Easy to apply, they glide right on but I do suggest wearing lip balm or chap stick underneath the tints. I tried all 15 colors on in like an hour so I could post pictures of the shades, somewhere in there I missed one apparently but you'll get the general idea. Also, excuse my sloppy application, my hands shake and my mouth was getting ra from removing them. They dry matte and quickly. Easy to remove with lipstick remover. Seemingly smudge proof so far, fingers crossed."

After trying them out, however, I am really impressed.  I've used a few of NYX's Lingerie matte liquid lipsticks (which these obviously aim to mimic by the packaging) and they work just as well, if not better than the NYX versions, which are $7-8 each.  Depending on the specific shade, some of these actually have more pigment and go on easier than the NYX colors that I have.  Some colors can feel a little sticky at first, but it's just a matter of giving them time to dry.  I swatched them all on my forearm and had to really scrub to get them off, so they definitely require more than just water to remove.  I haven't yet tried out the full 15 for daily wear, but those I have tested out have held up really well...I'm talking coffee, tacos, pasta, pizza, even a day-long Memorial Day barbecue, without ever really feeling the need to reapply.  The darker browns or reds may need a little more of a touch up than the others.  Some of the colors aren't necessarily what I'd go for; a little bolder than I'd like, but it's an excellent price if you want to give some new shades a try without much commitment. Would definitely purchase again."

But this says liquid matte so I assumed it would dry matte and would be long lasting but this product doesn‚Äôt dry/set. It stays wet. Like a lipgloss. Also if you look at my picture there‚Äôs a spot that looks like I didn‚Äôt cover it. What happened was I went over it a few times and it kind of just pushed the gloss around but wouldn‚Äôt fill in. If I rub my lips together the pigment pushes around like the pigment is separating from the gloss base? Kind of like oil and water.  I don‚Äôt understand. I will not repurchase.

It was just enough make up for a Zoom call, and relatively inexpensive. I don't know about durability because I don't need my makeup for more than a couple hours at most - sometimes for only half an hour at a time. I went back and bought a brighter color just to have some contrast. While the neutral color did not seem to have a scent the brighter bolder color has an unpleasant perfume-y smell to it.

Pros: the color is beautiful and the pigment is rich. The color goes on like butter and it doesn't dry out your lips. It didn't flake like most matte lipsticks. Cons: it is NOT smudge proof! It feels like it never really dries and it runs off very easily. It can be a bit difficult to get a smooth edge on it's own. It definitely smudged and rubbed off while eating.

All were liquids.  I could not find the right color for one thing.  The other is they looked painted on, not natural.  Been wearing Revlon Super Lustrous Blushing Mauve.  This is very close in color but just a slight more pink than my natural lip color, but usable.  So I ordered the Iconic color and that color comes close to matching my lips.  I reordered Socialite and Wardrobe.  Wardrobe is a bit more purplish than the picture.  It is a strong color like maybe a burnt red.  Socialite on the other hand is almost an exact match to my lip color.  Perfect for me, no more looking.  May try a few more colors if they go on sale for special occasions.  But for everyday use Socialite is for me, basically not noticable yet gives me even color over my whole lips and keeps my lips from the occasional peeling.  I took a drink after 10 minutes and had very little transfer and after 15 minutes had no transfer.  After about 40 minutes I ate a Pork Chop off the bone and did seem to lose a bit but color was still there, just worn down a bit.  I put it on at around 11 am and it was still there at 9 pm.  I have also used Preview on my upper lip and Iconic on the bottom lip then rubbed them together and end up with a color in between the two.  These people saying that it doesn't last must be constantly licking their lips or putting a lip balm on top of it."

The color is so beautiful, but it is not super pigmented.  When I first got it, I swatched it on my hand, and I was so surprised at how little it showed up.  I had to swipe it quite a few times on my lips to build up some color.  Lasting power is pretty good.  It's pretty comfortable.  The color was quite true to what was displayed-the color I got was what I expected.  I'm going to try wearing it with a lip primer underneath, and see how that goes.  I often find that helps with some of the dryer lipsticks in making them more comfortable.  But I like this enough to try other colors."

Hilton,,Verified Purchase,,Received this lipstick this past Mon.. Purchased the 70%Yum and its yummy lol.. The Choc Brown color is on point the applicator is shaped just like Maybelline Super Stay Matte Ink only difference is  L'Or√©al applicator moves up down when you apply so the applicator moves back and forth whereras Maybelline applicator stays in place when you apply on the lips.. The best way to describe it.. The applicator moves when applied vs Maybelline that stays still when applying... The one con.. Not a dealbreakerj for my preference. . The dry down takes too long where transfer will occur quickly vs other brands. . Pros. . One coat applied is needed. . 2 coats added.  Long drying time.. Once dried down will last the whole day

        ",Verified Purchase,,"This is pretty damn good. I have yet to find a product that stays on like this. This is nuts. I wore it for the first time today and took pictures throughout my day of my lips and how the color stayed. It stays pink basically the entire day. I did not reapply anything at any point, not even the gloss layer. I taught students, ate lunch, drank from a can, took my dog to the vet, licked my lips 900 times, and still have it on currently as I type this. We are going on about 8 hours. It has no sign of going away anytime soon, either. You can tell from the pictures that after a few hours the color start to fade from the inner lip, but it stays on enough in this particular shade that it still gives the impression of being fully on. I think if I had reapplied just once as a little touch up it would‚Äôve been super perfect. So that‚Äôs what my one star deduction is for (if they had half stars I‚Äôd only have taken a half for that)... a tiny part of the deduction too is the size. This tube is so small. But I guess since you really don‚Äôt need more than 1 touch up the entire day or day, (and it‚Äôs not $ at all) you won‚Äôt really be using it all the much. Plus, I think I can touch up once over 8 hours and still consider it ‚Äúall day wear‚Äù.  This stuff is amazing. I‚Äôd like other shades but I‚Äôm afraid they won‚Äôt last as good. But everyone‚Äôs reviews seem to be pretty across the board.  I mean look at my pics... that sh^t barely budged all day."

I apply once per directions, and then throughout the day I just use whatever lip balm I have on me to moisturize; it refreshes the look and keeps my lips happy - the color stays, but the moisturizing top coat does not.  The lip color itself is sticky and I've used better applicators, but it's not hard to put on at all.  It dries quickly.  There's been a little bit of color transfer onto the top coat brush applicator, but once the top coat is on, the color isn't getting on anything.  I've been looking for something to use for my upcoming wedding, and I think this is it, because it lasts through food and coffee and I won't be leaving any color on the groom's lips, which I am sure he'll appreciate ;)."

To my surprise, it lasts even through a meal!  Because I am 67 years old, I don't like a thick heavy coating on my lips. Magic Kiss looks so natural and makes my lips look smooth and more youthful. This variety pack gives you to options, blue and green for cooler reds or darker pinks,  orange and yellow for subtle shades of peach. I am an island girl with tan skin and darker lips. Even with darker skin, these shades might look different on you. The formula really adapts to your body chemistry and temperature.  I prefer more peach than pink, so the orange and yellow sticks look best on me. I can top it with my favorite red lip stain to intensify the color but not too much. Seriously, for the price, take a chance and try this brand."

Since they're so close to my nose (duh ;) ), I find myself avoiding any that smell perfumey, waxy, or even (so oddly) kind of rancid. The color of this lipstick is absolutely stunning - a neutral mauve / rose / brown - and the texture is nice and creamy. Time will tell if I end up loving it or not, but already I'm finding the scent off-putting and gravitating toward other lipsticks with less offensive smells. It's possible that this one just sat around in a warehouse too long, but whatever it is, it's not a smell I want to experience for very long or very often. Given that I wanted this to be my new everyday go-to lipstick, that's really disappointing and for that I give it only 4 stars.

In reviews online, it looked like almost like a deep red, and I read many reviews that described it as ""bright"" and a ""blue red."" It is not! No, this is a warm red for sure. I compared it to Mac Ruby Woo and Armani 400 (I use both luxury and drugstore lip colors) and this is a warm, almost even kind of rusty red. It's nicely pigmented, but I wouldn't call it ""bright"" either. I'm not sure that this really does anything for my warm olive skintone. I also got 107, and I like that one much better (it's darker and has a better scent). The scent on 001 is fruity, but quite mild.

It's actually darker with a shimmer (take note of the 3rd row of pics featured by the seller) and I absolutely LOVE IT!  So much better than the first couple pics and is my new fave over Katy Perry's Catoure which I also love but Catoure needs several back and forth strokes for good pigmentation, frequent reapplications and while its also a great product, this Coffee Crave just needs a swipe top and bottom and bam, you're done for a good long while.  It looks spectacular.  The sparkly shimmer was an unexpected bonus and very flattering on me.  As I'm nearing 50, I'm starting to note difficulties with product gathering into lip lines.  This product does just a little bit but overall stays in place (including no transfer to my teeth!) which is noteworthy since it's a very moisturizing product and I would have expected it to bleed significantly.  With many lipsticks costing $8 and $9 or even more in stores, this one at $5.79 is fairly priced and I see many other colors even cheaper in the $3 and $4 range.  Assuming they all have similar properties as this Coffee Crave in pigmentation, moisturization and length of wear, this is a bargain product."

The gloss smells like roses, which I love. And it seems to wear down very comfortably as well, doesn‚Äôt dry your lips out, very moisturizing, and not sticky. I will be purchasing more shades."

It stays on and hydrates your lips. Doesn‚Äôt feel heavy or sticky or like it‚Äôll will dry your lips out! Absolutely loved it. Bonus on the small massaging ‚Äònubs‚Äô on the applicator.

I like the idea of a tip that exfoliates your lips but it's just like a little silicone scrubber that makes the product go on very streaky (and then almost completely disappear when smoothed out with this color).  It felt super nice on my lips and didn't seem to be scented which I liked but then I found the taste really gross. I ended up taking it right off and returned it.  I just won't use it as it ticks very few boxes of what I thought it could be."

Both are plenty dark enough to boldly define my lips, but also remarkably natural in appearance. The brush itself mildly exfoliates while applying, and the moisture is more than ample. Also remarkable is the staying power of these balms considering their sheerness and moisturizing benefit. It also comes in clear for those who prefer no color. I think these lip balms are really terrific and I will order more for myself and as gifts."

        ",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"These lipsticks are absolutely amazing!! I love them. The packaging is cute with the sea theme. The lipstick tubes themselves are SO pretty, I've already shown these off a few times (to friends and strangers!). These are very long lasting, and the lipstick formula acts almost like a lip stain but not as strong as that. The blue lasted me a good 8 hours. Not kidding. The color is very vibrant and attractive. You do need to let the lipstick dry completely before concealing the edges of your lips or feathering may happen (it did for me). When I applied the lipstick and then made sure it was dry, there was no feathering at all. Nada. The feel was very light on my lips; the color was fully saturated yet it didn't feel heavy or overbearing. I totally recommend this product, not only because of the excellent performance and vibrant colors, also because the tubes are adorable and so fun to show off. Great product and would make a lovely gift!"

They looked so cute, but I was worried they were just a gimmick with the mermaid tails and that the liquid lipstick would underperform. Luckily, I had nothing to worry about, because I absolutely love this set and it has surpassed all of my expectations. I absolutely LOVE the colors! They're bold and retro with colors that are true to the listing pictures. They remind me of what I used to wear back in the day. They're perfect for work or a night out at the club. The matte finish feels velvety and looks beautiful. The liquid has a high saturation rate, which performs more like a lip stain than a lipstick. I was surprised that they truly are waterproof, so you do get all day coverage and your lips don't dry out. Each mermaid container is unique with different colors, which are super fun. I highly recommend this product!"

I've used a few different shades and have been pleased with all of them. It stays on for a very long time and doesn't leave my lips feeling like they've been coated in gunk. It does dry your lips out a bit, but thats normal with long-wear lip products and is easily fixed with some chapstick after removing it in the evening. I'd also suggest to put this product on layer by layer. I hate when I can feel product on my lips, and making sure you give each thin layer a chance to dry before building up the color really helps with that."

I prefer a more natural/subtle look, so I only put one layer on the inside of the lips (as suggested), then smear it with my finger to cover the rest of the lips, and use a makeup remover to clean up the lines. I put on lip balm on top to keep my lips from drying.  This stays on all day until I remove it.  Even after eating greasy food, it barely fades. I just re-apply lip balm, and not have to worry about looking in the mirror.  The first picture is without any lipstick, the others are with the lightest application of 4 colors.

To my surprise, it lasts even through a meal!  Because I am 67 years old, I don't like a thick heavy coating on my lips. Magic Kiss looks so natural and makes my lips look smooth and more youthful. This variety pack gives you to options, blue and green for cooler reds or darker pinks,  orange and yellow for subtle shades of peach. I am an island girl with tan skin and darker lips. Even with darker skin, these shades might look different on you. The formula really adapts to your body chemistry and temperature.  I prefer more peach than pink, so the orange and yellow sticks look best on me. I can top it with my favorite red lip stain to intensify the color but not too much. Seriously, for the price, take a chance and try this brand."

Since they're so close to my nose (duh ;) ), I find myself avoiding any that smell perfumey, waxy, or even (so oddly) kind of rancid. The color of this lipstick is absolutely stunning - a neutral mauve / rose / brown - and the texture is nice and creamy. Time will tell if I end up loving it or not, but already I'm finding the scent off-putting and gravitating toward other lipsticks with less offensive smells. It's possible that this one just sat around in a warehouse too long, but whatever it is, it's not a smell I want to experience for very long or very often. Given that I wanted this to be my new everyday go-to lipstick, that's really disappointing and for that I give it only 4 stars.

In reviews online, it looked like almost like a deep red, and I read many reviews that described it as ""bright"" and a ""blue red."" It is not! No, this is a warm red for sure. I compared it to Mac Ruby Woo and Armani 400 (I use both luxury and drugstore lip colors) and this is a warm, almost even kind of rusty red. It's nicely pigmented, but I wouldn't call it ""bright"" either. I'm not sure that this really does anything for my warm olive skintone. I also got 107, and I like that one much better (it's darker and has a better scent). The scent on 001 is fruity, but quite mild.

Some make your teeth look yellow like a toxic substance, others are unflattering to your skin tone and then a lot of them are drying or bleed or smear all over your face.  I know I can put this lipstick on in the morning (even though I'm not going anywhere I still wear it - strictly for me) and it will still look good before I take it off at night.  So it lasts through lunch, dinner, a snack or 2 and several coffees, pops, waters and tea.  If I eat something that has some oil in it the inner part of my lips might need a touch up but normally I don't touch it all day.  It makes me look better with it than I look without it.  Even my adult son who mostly hates the look of lipsticks on anyone has complimented me on this lipstick.  I think his exact words were - 'nice lipstick'!

The color I received which is the one I ordered so the name matches, is more red tone than a brownish tone.  It's almost bright red.  I am Hispanic so bright Red tones are not flattering at all with my skin tone. I needed something with more brown tone to it. I contacted the seller to see if I could return the item but no returns are allowed.  So I'm very disappointed with this purchase."

B00ON1HJDS,2022,1,24,1,Third row image is the most representative,4.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2019",coffeehound,,Verified Purchase,,"I was expecting a neutral matte lipstick.  It's actually darker with a shimmer (take note of the 3rd row of pics featured by the seller) and I absolutely LOVE IT!  So much better than the first couple pics and is my new fave over Katy Perry's Catoure which I also love but Catoure needs several back and forth strokes for good pigmentation, frequent reapplications and while its also a great product, this Coffee Crave just needs a swipe top and bottom and bam, you're done for a good long while.  It looks spectacular.  The sparkly shimmer was an unexpected bonus and very flattering on me.  As I'm nearing 50, I'm starting to note difficulties with product gathering into lip lines.  This product does just a little bit but overall stays in place (including no transfer to my teeth!) which is noteworthy since it's a very moisturizing product and I would have expected it to bleed significantly.  With many lipsticks costing $8 and $9 or even more in stores, this one at $5.79 is fairly priced and I see many other colors even cheaper in the $3 and $4 range.  Assuming they all have similar properties as this Coffee Crave in pigmentation, moisturization and length of wear, this is a bargain product."

Pros: the color is beautiful and the pigment is rich. The color goes on like butter and it doesn't dry out your lips. It didn't flake like most matte lipsticks. Cons: it is NOT smudge proof! It feels like it never really dries and it runs off very easily. It can be a bit difficult to get a smooth edge on it's own. It definitely smudged and rubbed off while eating.

The shade ""Fearless"" seemed to fit, and the price was right to take a chance and give it a try. - I'm so glad that I did! This liquid lip is actually comfortable and not drying whatsoever. It does not last through eating or drinking, but it stays put through normal talking and rigorous dance, so that's enough for me. It also does not bleed into my very fine lip lines or bunch up on the inner lip (huzzah!)

Hands down probably the best drugstore matte that rivals high end.,5.0 out of 5 stars,11 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2021",Vanessa Arroyo,,Verified Purchase,,"What a beautiful brown! My favorite shades are hot chocolate (pictured) and Shameless. Both beautiful for muted-warm olive skin tones. Like all bullet lipsticks, this is not super long lasting and you'll have to reapply, but for a bullet lipstick the longevity is good. I've tried just about all drugstore bullet lipsticks. Hands down this is the best one, especially for a matte. The Maybelline ones are a nice formula with a wide shade range but I can't stand the waxy cosmetic smell and taste. The Milani Color Statement has beautiful brown-red shades and the formula is long lasting but can tug on the lips if they're not well prepped. NYX Suede Matte is a very nice formula as well just not as creamy and easy to glide as this one and can also be a little tuggy if you have very dry patches. The L'Or√©al ones I just can't stand the floral smell, which is disappointing because their shades are beautiful. The Milani Color Fetish Mattes are probably a close second favorite to this Revlon one but they only have 5 nude shades -  wish they made more. I just wish Revlon made more rosey-brown reds (like NYX exotic), muted terracota browns, and more muted brick red shades. Please make more shades! If they expand their shade range I think most of my bullet lipsticks would be from this line. Y'all are sleeping on Revlon bullet lipsticks! I choose these over my MAC or other more expensive lipsticks any day, especially for the price. I've heard people say these are dupes formula-wise for the Lisa Eldridge velvet matte lipsticks but I don't have one to compare. The only thing I will say is Revlon needs to work on making the pictures more true to color as they're way off. Probably would help to have arm swatches."

The formula applies like a silky balm and feels lucious on the lips! No pilling or globs, just smooth, creamy lipstick! It's very nourishing, I feel like it definitely keeps my lips moisturized. I purchased the creamy Spiced Petal and the color is so natural. It's slightly darker than my natural lip color. Makes my lips look naturally flawless with a flush of color. I apply one coat for a natural finish, and two gives good coverage for a more made up lip. I also adore the packaging. It's very luxurious and the white and gold is very pretty. I love how the cover snaps into place too. I've always loved Drew Barrymore and I'm so glad her lipstick is a total win! Overall great product and I definitely recommend ! I'm definitely thinking about trying other products in the line."

Covergirl Outlast lipcolors have solved this problem for me! Lipcolor evens out my lip color and lasts for a good 8-10 hrs only fading slightly (yet evenly) as the day wears on. The colors are good neutral shades, as well... I have at least 5 shades that are good on me depending on the look I want. I usually line outside with a slightly darker color for defined look and then immediately swipe a coordinating paler color on central lip, blending with my finger before it sets. This seems to give my lip color a more natural look. Love this lipcolor!"

I forgot my Lip Ink on a business trip and ran to the drugstore for a replacement. I bought Outlast and fell in love. It lasts as long as Lip Ink, but looks like a matte lipstick. It did wear off after 10 hours, but after playing around with it, I learned the trick: If you apply two coats, it can last over 24 hours  I put on two coats at 7AM every day. When I get home from work nearly 12 hours later, it still looks freshly applied! I replaced my dark red Cosmo Red Lip Ink and 840 Scarlet. I replaced my everyday nude Sand Wood Lip Ink with 621 Natural. I replaced old school bright red Energy Red Lip Ink with 820 Red.  It cost much less than Lip Ink and, with the convenience of Subscribe and Save, I don't even have to make a trip to the drugstore for it!"

Kilgore,,Verified Purchase,,"My ol Loreal fave from my teen years (circa 89-90) was a lovely frosty shade of plum/mauve. I believe it was called Plumrose or maybe even Primrose. Anyhoo ‚Ä¶ since they quit making it I've moved on. Switched to all natural, cruelty free, professional brand. But when I saw ""Primrose"" here on Amazon I couldn't resist seeing if it was indeed my old favorite from back in the day. Kind of thought based on the color swatch pictures I'd gotten lucky as it looked to be a very close match. Not so much. It's very pink, not at all frosty, and not even close to the swatch. I tried again with Soft Mauve thinking it might be less ""pink"" and more rose/plum/mauve and maybe ""the one"". Nope. It's almost the exact same shade as the Primrose. Both are too bright/pink and lean more to what I'd call fuchsia than plum or rose or even mauve. They both arrived just tossed in a box, no packaging, no seal, nothing. They appeared to be new/unused despite not seal. Going on they feel smooth and you can tell they have oils in them. I got about ten seconds of wear out of it before it disappeared. I wasn't expecting long-wearing but ten seconds? You'd literally have to carry these around in your hand all day and keep reapplying them constantly if you ended up liking the color (which I didn't). So, back to my new favorite brand I go and will give up the search for my long-lost favorite from way back when. Oh well."

The colors are good neutral shades, as well... I have at least 5 shades that are good on me depending on the look I want. I usually line outside with a slightly darker color for defined look and then immediately swipe a coordinating paler color on central lip, blending with my finger before it sets.

I swear if L'Oreal removes the violet/powder scent from their lipsticks, I am done with drugstore brands. But, I digress. Revlon makes a pretty decent, long-wearing lipstick for the money. I like how the reds never change color over the course of hours of eating, drinking, talking, kissing (ahem), well you get the picture... My fave shade for years has been ""wine with everything"" but coming in close is ""pink in the after-noon."" The product clings to the lips but does not dry out, will not smear off - even in the middle of pandemic pandamonium the red will barely blot onto the mask. Also makes nice neat kiss marks on your stationery if you are sending a love note to your honey. ;)"

Heaton,,Verified Purchase,,"I got the color Smile and it was perfect! I have very pale skin and light pink lips. This color was just enough red to make my lips pop but not so much I looked like I was feeling amorous. I usually try to highlight natural parts of my beauty rather than cover it up, so don‚Äôt fear it will be too dark on pale skin. I do have skin that dries easily and it doesn‚Äôt seem to moisturize very much, but some lipsticks make my lips crack so I can live with that. I‚Äôd recommend it if you prefer colors closer to natural lips. The photo I provided had darkened lighting but that‚Äôs pretty close to how it came out."

I found my dupe w/Skip the Gym and actually feel like it lasts longer than Mac's did.  I have bought 8 shades in total and love the cream and matte finishes, although personally I lean more towards cream.  I feel like all of the colors I could wear any day (some w/less makeup overall) w/o looking like a clown.  The darker colors wear off really nicely too, although they will transfer but not an insane amount."

And these colors for someone with skin like mine where it's hard to wear lipstick without looking like a clown.

The color was dark, but looked more like clay than lipstick, no satin finish there.  I thought maybe once it was on, it would melt or something. But, once I put it on, and I had to use several swipes to get the product on my lips, I looked at totally matte color.  And the product was hard to put on, the texture was like sticky dough, and really didn't blend evenly no matter how many times I put a kleenex between my lips to blot it.

They feel amazing on my lips.  Glides on smoothly, can be built up easily by adding more and more layers, smells like sweet vanilla, and lasts hours longer on my lips than a typical balm or creamy lip product. My favorite part about these: the super inexpensive price! I've tried some ""luxury"" lipsticks here lately and honestly there's no reason for me to spend more than $10 on a decent lipstick when these Sensational lippies and colors are out on the market. A lot of expensive brands are too drying or are nice and creamy but don't last long, which kinda defeats the purpose of spending a lot of dough on something. Maybelline's got the best of both worlds.  I have this in Brazen Berry (goes on a beautiful fuchsia pink but can be built up to a bright purple) and Electric Orange (which is definitely electric!).  These lipsticks are great and for the price you should pick up a few different colors!"

No shade, but some products do not look great on our skin. Case in point: Beauty Glazed Matte Liquid Lipstick. I put all six colors on my outer arm (where we tend to be more melaninated from the sun) to see how they look with my undertones. The first two are a hard pass but I can use them in conjunction with other shades to create custom colors. The second two were  better and maybe can be used when I wear my lips two-toned (upper lip different color from bottom). The last two were slam dunks! Right on the money with my mahogany skin. These are good enough to stand alone. Now for the product performance; there is a marked difference between how to product felt on my arm vs lips. The reason for that is we tend to moisturize our lips with oil before applying the lip color. I use organic unrefined coconut oil. While oil made it glide on smoothly, it also made the product sticky. I noticed the arm samples dried completely and refused to budge. There was no oil on my arm. The color stuck so well to my arm I had to forcefully scrub with a makeup remover cloth to get all of it off. However, my lip color smudged and became tacky. The difference is the application of oil. Do not put oil on before the color and it will stay put without being sticky. The colors smell like chocolate though there is no flavor. Overall, the product is good."

Goes on wet for about 10 seconds then dries so you have a short window to change it before it dries. Once dried it has an almost sticky feel when you close your mouth but that's majority matte lipsticks anyway. Maybe put a little chapstick if that bothers you but color is nice and you don't need 20 coats to make it pop.

I tried a more expensive lip color with the same procedure (you put on the color, let dry, then add the lip gloss). But the expensive one I tried was not any better than Covergirl. I cannot use a regular lip stick because it just will not stay on at all. Outlast will last a long time, but of course it will fade when you eat or drink often."

Ive owned it before and loved the moisturizing aspect. However, what was delivered to me was not an authentic product. A)The tube is different. The real CoverGirl product has a shorter top and longer tube. This one has a much longer too, leading me first to realize there is probably less product. B)the packaging doesnt match. The CoverGirl logo is in the right font, and the strip is black, not silver, like every other CG product ever. C) the product itself was clearer than the one i used to own, meaning theres less lotion, and more petroleum jelly."

Covergirl Outlast lipcolors have solved this problem for me! Lipcolor evens out my lip color and lasts for a good 8-10 hrs only fading slightly (yet evenly) as the day wears on. The colors are good neutral shades, as well... I have at least 5 shades that are good on me depending on the look I want. I usually line outside with a slightly darker color for defined look and then immediately swipe a coordinating paler color on central lip, blending with my finger before it sets. This seems to give my lip color a more natural look. Love this lipcolor!"

When I get home from work nearly 12 hours later, it still looks freshly applied! I replaced my dark red Cosmo Red Lip Ink and 840 Scarlet. I replaced my everyday nude Sand Wood Lip Ink with 621 Natural. I replaced old school bright red Energy Red Lip Ink with 820 Red.

I happened upon a Lipstick Queen Mini Duo a few years ago and this color (St. Mauve) was one of the two.  I've been hooked on it ever since and the tiny little mini has lasted and lasted!  I decided to buy the full size for my daily make-up routine and put the mini in my purse.  It is pricey when you can purchase a drug-store lipstick for so much less, but I have a boatload of drug-store lipsticks that I never use because the color just isn't right.  This is one I use so it's worth it.  It provides me with a nice, natural look, not too ""made-up"" or ""overly done"".  Just a slip of color.  It does not dry my lips out like other lipsticks do.  No flaking at all and no bleeding outside the lip line even though I never use a lip liner.  On me, the color comes out a bit lighter on my lips than it appears to look in the tube, which is just fine.  This one is a winner!"

However it becomes so difficult to touch up due to the matte nature, so I bought this for touch ups. However, there is such a pretty amount of pigment (it's NOT too sheer like some lipstick queen products can be) and it's so easy to apply (great for beginners and those like me who get impatient and have weirdly shaped lips that are difficult to color). Feels great on the lips, not too slippery like a gloss, not too thick like heavier lipsticks."

I wouldn't call this a MLBB (my lips, but better) as it is darker than my lips and more of a berry shade than my lips which are a reddish pink. However, I am quite fair, so for those with medium-dark to deep skin colors I'm sure this would look like more of a match for your natural lip color. Again though, I think this color would be beautiful on anyone. The formula is moisturizing and feels like a lip balm. For a ""saint"" lipstick, it is actually quite pigmented. However, it looks totally different from the sinner version of this shade, which I found to be more brownish-red."

It was gross and uneven and dried pretty weirdly. The trick is to smile slightly to make the surface of your lips a bit taut. Wipe off any excess lip product from the lip applicator. There's just way too much on there right out of the tube. Now smooth the lip cream on your lips as evenly as possible preferably in one to two swipes. If you keep going back and forth too many times, it gets all bunchy and gross bc it starts to dry if you take too long. Let dry for a minute in that smile position.  Then apply the gloss over top. Just my two cents. It seemed to work great with this method. Goodluck!"

This is the only lipstick I know of that really does stay on all day. I have put on this lipstick and then less than a minute after it dried brushed my teeth, and not had any transfer of the lipstick. I can drink from glasses and kiss without leaving stains too! Use the moisturizer often, though, because this does tend to dry out your lips, and if they get too dry and start flaking then you have to redo the lip stain. If you do need to redo the stain, wash your lips of all the moisturizer first, because the stain doesn't go on well over moist lips."

B004679G7G,2022,1,24,8,I LOVE this lipstick/ALMOST 100%,4.0 out of 5 stars,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2021",OMGdannibale,,Verified Purchase,,"I like being able to apply lipstick in the morning, and have it last all day. Maybelline SuperStay does that for the *most* part. This is a 2-step product. You apply the color tint first using a sponge-type brush. Wait about a minute or so (while applying mascara maybe?) til the color sets, then apply the moistener. I've only liked one color, of this brand for my skin type. So my review is specific to Reliable Raspberry. If I'm applying late in the day, (to go out for instance) I will wake up in the morning with the lipstick still on a bit. It's nice that it doesn't rub off on coffee cups, straws, forks, or your man's collar! The one thing I do NOT like about this lipstick is that it has a tendency to dry up and actually crack sometimes. Not always. So when that happens, another application is needed. This item is spendy in the drug stores (Walgreen's, RiteAid, CVS), but it does go on sale in the stores for a Buy One, Get One 50% off... which  I HATE those sales. Sometimes you can get lucky and the store will only have 1 in stock; they'll give you the 25% off without having to buy 2 items. (WHEN will these damn stores get it, that we can't always afford out of pocket to buy multiples!!)"

GUYS I'M SO SHOOK. This lipstick is less than $5 and is legit the same quality, if not better, than the Stila stay all day that retails for $27. THE ONLY ""downside"" which isn't even a downside, is the lipstick is a little bit more orange-red than a classic red that I expected (I got the shade Flame of the Game). BUT I LOVE IT. It's a total dupe for the Hot Fire DesixKaty lipstick. Guys, I kissed my hand for a test and it didn't transfer at all. It feels soft and isn't like a damn desert on my lips.

I tested pressing my lips against my hand, drinking from a glass and using a straw, and it didn't rub off on anything. I'm pretty finicky when it comes to lipstick, so the reason this isn't 5 stars, is because it made my lips feel dry. It wasn't unbearable or unexpected, but just something to keep in mind.

I have never given a product one STAR but this product really is not what appears to be in the picture.  So let me go down the list for DELIVERY I will give it five STARS because it arrived on time.  It's not a lip stick that you can easily apply.  It does not just glide right on.  It's a MATTE type of lipstick that actually sticks to your lips and your skin when you try to wipe it off.  For those who would like to sleep in their lipstick this type would be the perfect lipstick to buy.  But for those like myself who are done with MAKEUP after the work day is over it just won't do.  I need to be able to wash my make up off ...including the lipstick without worrying about it still be on my lips the next morning.  Is it flattering NO!  It's dry and you have to literally apply it with your fingers in order not to put on too much. The problem is...it sticks to your fingers even after you try to wash it off.  It's awful!  The color is not flattering.  It looks black on my lips and I'm brown skinned.  The other one I purchased is supposed to be RED!  It also sticks and when I apply it using the brush... I still have to use my finger fore finger to spread it over my lips.  If not...I would have applied too much and then I would look like a clown.  Not a good product at all! Bring back the lip stick that easy to spread on your lips without any problems!  It's just too much work now a day to apply makeup of any kind

This is not intended to be a moisturizing lipstick at all. This line is extremely mat and long lasting, like a stain/tattoo type product. Once you put this on, it is not coming off. I like a satin or gloss finish so, I just put some clear gloss or a complementary neon pink gloss over it and it‚Äôs perfect. I love how it is so long lasting you can literally eat whole meals and the color does not budge. All you would have to do is touch up the gloss type product that you may put on the top. Wet and wild has A lipstick called, kiss my glass which is a very similar neon pink pigment. I either put this on top or just use something totally clear period although I do not, many ladies do wear these straight on their own without putting anything over the top and keep a totally matte finish lip."

They're more on the orange spectrum and they were too drying after a few hours and flaked off. It almost felt like the consistency of a waxed crayon when they dried and crumbled off. The 1st layer did stay a bit longer for the more pigmented orange colors but I still had to reapply after a few hours and they also dried and crumbled off in the end. You do get 6 colors to choose from but mixing them did not fair so well as 2 of them were very similar and the 3 that I didn't like again were on the orange side. The only color I did like was the 2nd color but the consistency is what I could not stand and continue wearing all day.

I wish I had a dime for every tube of lipstick like this I have bought on a gamble based on  the erroneous color of the outside tube.  It is not the same color ""bubblegum pink"" that I can never seem to find anymore.  Why can't they get this shade correct?  When I say ""they"" I mean EVERYONE who makes lipsticks including M.A.C, NYX and more expensive brands. NYX gets it close, it looks correct but when you put it on the pigment changes somehow.  I'm a lipstick junkie and I've only had 2 tubes of this color lipstick that were correct, one was made by Maybelline back in the early-mid 90s and another was a tube I bought on a whim at an exclusive clothing boutique.  It was some unknown brand but it was the best pastel pink lipstick EVER!  I treasured that lipstick for a long time until it finally ran out.  And Maybelline changed their formula to the waxy, not enough pigment junk they have now.  The only thing I can find anymore that looks so so is NYX Baby Pink which is kind of purple but it works for me.  I have a very weird skin tone that only looks good with pale pinks and coral/pinks even though I am well on the north end of middle age now.  Red looks creepy on me and ""nude"" and darker brownish/gold colors make me look like I've been eating raw meat without wiping my mouth.  Ugh"

Really, really strong smell. I really like the color‚Äîexactly what I was looking for. But it‚Äôs very difficult to go on smooth, and since it‚Äôs lighter than my natural lip color and it goes on chunky, it‚Äôs very noticeable. To remedy this, I exfoliate my lips, moisturize, apply the lipstick, then apply moisturizer again in a circular pattern to evenly disperse the color. A lot of work. I tried to return it, found that I would have to drive it somewhere to do so instead of just a pick up, and decided to just make it work.

The color darkens slightly after 30 mins but remains same tone and is probably the truest color match to the tube, meaning it is slightly lighter when it first goes on.  It wears long 8-24 hours depending on whether you let it dry properly before ""using your lips"" and how much you drink, lick, chew on you lips etc. it does not have any flavor and it is not sticky and thick.

I've invested quite a bit of money to sample as many brands as possible to find one that lasts more then a few hours. I wanted something with the colors of Stilla (beautiful colors but feathered after a few hours and did not last through eating/drinking) bottom line, after trying over a dozen different products (ranging from 30$ to 4$) this is without a doubt everything I've ever wanted. Perfect color, easy application, no feathering or drying. I can eat, drink, smoke with no transfer at all. I can even shower without it coming off or feathering. Last night I tried a new color and fell asleep with it on, woke up and looked like I just applied it. I have 6 different colors so far. I'll never buy anything else."

This brand lip stick has become my favorite on the job lipstick. If there is a down side to wearing this brand's lipstick it is that the surface is mildly tacky but it is relieved with the application of the gloss on the opposite side of the applicator. However, you lose the matte finish with the gloss, When compared to 'Lime Crime' it is superior in stay on power and the applicator brush. However, another down side is the choice of colors in which Lime Crime definitely has them beat. But I love this product!"

Also the color didn't turn out how I thought it would, it's a bit more orange than I expected. Does not look good on me at all like the one she had, which I thought was the same one! I can't even give this away, all my friends think it looks too orange."

The worst offender of the bunch is the dark burgundy. I went around & around with it & never got good coverage. It looked like I let a 5-year-old apply it. Then it smeared at the corners of my mouth & I couldn‚Äôt wipe it away. I used makeup remover & it still left a pink stain."

        ",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"These are very highly pigmented matte lipsticks.  They go on with dark/very heavy coverage and stay for hours!  They come in clear tubes so that you can see the color of the lipstick within, which is very convenient to choose the color you want.  Each tube has an applicator wand.

        ",,Vine Customer Review of Free Product,"I like the way matte lipstick looks but I've never been a big fan of wearing matte lipstick. I had hoped this selection would change my mind. Not really. The lipstick goes on easily and can be custom blended with all the shades in the box--and it is a nice selection of colors--so that's good. For me though, the problem with these and other matte lipsticks is that while it goes on smoothly and looks nice, it feels tacky on my lips and has this drying effect that makes me keep licking my lips. I just can't seem to get over that and usually end up putting a gloss or chapstick on over top of the matte lipstick. These lipsticks do stay on well and have a nice matte finish, but... As far as wearing them all day, I end up as I said, putting on chapstick over the top to control the very slight tackiness and the slightly drying effect of the lipstick. Folks that like matte lipstick and don't have those same issues (it may just be that I don't wear matte lipstick enough to get used to the feel) will love this selection as the lipsticks are easy to put on and come in a lot of nice colors."
